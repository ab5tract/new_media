# Blog Meeting Notes #

## Towards a Final Vision ##

For the most part it seems that we would like to translate the [space collective](http://spacecollective.org/recent) into a WordPress theme for the MoM blog.


## Decision Making Process ##

Collectively discuss the fonts and colors. Then we can break down into "modules" or ("cells" hehe) and work on the specific tasks. (This will be done today.)

In the future, we can send out updates to the MoM blog. Also, feedback through the MoM movie nights.

Tuesday face-to-face meetings will continue, including next week during the vacation.

## Tasks ##

There is a [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1ZGTzLq6wW9hMFBGeSBmRppBM9R8zYv_8oaT5SGRcOG8&hl=en&authkey=CM3E6IgG&pli=1#) describing some of the tasks we will need to accomplish.

## Roles ##

- Bart: graphic design (headers, etc)
- Laila: interaction design
- Onur, John: coding, technical implementation

# Blog Meeting Notes - 26 October 2010 #

## Thoughts on the Designs So Far ##

### [Bart's Design](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_flzb5wPUcXE/TMRNuWfVMcI/AAAAAAAAAYE/P2uN0fr-hc0/s1600/one.jpg)) ###

- Bart's design has a nice continuity with the existing MoM blog.
- The pixelized per-post headers: John and Laila like them, Marte not so much. Perhaps they are too "intense" to be repeated so often on the page.
    - Maybe we could use a small variation of it, like one or two "rows" of pixels that serve as sort of a top-boundary for the post 'cards'. 

### [Laila's Design](http://lailakoubia.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/mom-blog-redesign/) ###

- Background might be a bit too dark.
- The header is playful without detracting from the academic tone. Since the content is rarely very playful, it is nice to have at least a little bit on th site.
- Gradation in the header makes the "tech blue" look more inviting.
- Lack of sidebars allows for a clean design that seems oriented towards the text/content.

### Marte's Design ###

- The shape of the MoM logo on the 'brown' version is really nice. How could we incorporate it? Should we consider replacing the "square" version we have now?

## Interaction Decisions ##

- **No categories!** The search function will suffice.
- **No more Lorem Ipsum!!** We need to design around real-use scenarios. Length of a post title, poster's name, number of tags, etc., will all change the requirements of the design. 
    - Let's take a look at how Space Collective manages these issues.
- Blogroll should maybe turn into 

## Fun Things to Do List (What We Are Thinking About) ##

- Look into the Processing library 'wordookie' for a dynamic header made from popular tags for the week (John)
- Research Masonry to determine how easy it makes the 'post cards' interface. (John)
- Look into the card structure. What info do we _need_ to be displayed automatically verus what can appear later (mouse over or onclick)?
- For Laila, how do the current "side bars" fit into your design?

## Checklist of Elements We Need to Integrate ##

- Header / logo
- Postcard front / postcard back
- Full post (permanent link)
- Search results (with "Older posts.." and "Newer posts" links)
- Archive
- About / Contact / Style Specifications / etc.. (top right box)
- Contributer list
- Author pages
- Recent comments
- Popular posts this month
- Blogroll (should be folded into a new "links" page)
- Tag cloud

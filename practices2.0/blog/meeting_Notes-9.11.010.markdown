# Meeting Notes - 9 November 2010 #

## Onur's Cards ##

- fixed title div size, with variable font size seems to work best
    - how technically difficult is the variable font size for titles?

- Jura all the way :)

- maybe move author information to the bottom of the card

- add a 'tags' button under the title that on mouse over expands to list the tags

- could we remove the date from the front of the card?


## Anouka's Cards/Design ##

- great shape!
    - perhaps even more "angular" on the 'non-corner corners', ie make it a straight line?
- drop shadow looks great as well, but only available if we don't use a black background

- author's name stands prominently at the top, its visual position implying it is the most relevant info relating to the post, confusing

- the roll-out titles only add info from tags, which makes the roll-out seem like it exists just because it looks cool

- less tall than the ones from Laila's template
    - do we want taller ones? maybe yes, maybe no..

- there seems to be an unfortunate visual incompatibility between barts logo and Anouka's header as they currently are
    - maybe an issue of background color?

- the header itself seems at odds with the page as we currently envision
    - the layout is so clean, where this header introduces a sort of clutter that contrasts negatively
    - is it possible to retain this generated "cloud" idea without running into this conflict between clean layout and cluttered header?

## Bart's logos ##

### [http://bbrodzkiart.blogspot.com/2010/11/masters-of-media-logo.html](http://bbrodzkiart.blogspot.com/2010/11/masters-of-media-logo.html) ###

- second logo reminds Onur of a Hitler face
- perhaps we should use the official UvA logo (ie the positioning found in the second pair of designs)

- Masters of Media could be in a larger font (especially if we go with a design that doesn't incorporate the QR code)

- Onur and Marte like the non-slanted title better
    - the slant doesn't visually reference anything else on the page

- regarding the [colored](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_flzb5wPUcXE/TNLMYNkQo_I/AAAAAAAAAYU/LlOMoe0lzgg/s1600/Page+3+jpg.jpg) variants:
    - icy blue == Onur likes it
    - whether we use color or not depends on our decision regarding the header. for instance, Anouka's header design would probably work best with a black background on the logo

### Google-ized logo backgrounds ###

- this leads us to discuss the "Google-ized" backgrounds for the icon that Bart sent in a zip file
    - the idea is the background changes according to special days
    - would we always have an image in the background, or do it more like 
Google where the new logos are exciting precisely because usually the home page is so neutral/boring

- what kind of header would actually work with this idea? 
    - perhaps the changing background makes it visually appealing enough that it could stand alone as the header
    - otherwise: what?

## Hanneke's Interaction Design ##

- no easily available copy of MS Visio to check it out :(

## Background Colors ##

- neutral is necessary
    - we don't know the header yet
    - we also don't have control over images
- strong candidate: #515455
    - how does it look with drop shadows?
    

## TODO ##

- work out new header concepts
- integrate Anouka's cards with Onur's design
- think more about whether we actually want a "back of the card" that appears on mouse over
    - if the back only appears after a click, why wouldn't we just go to the post itself?
    - effect for the sake of effect is a dengerous design decision, but if it serves a reasonable purpose then its great
- think about the menu, intregrate Hanneke's critique int our thinking
    - where does it go and what is absolutely necessary to be there?

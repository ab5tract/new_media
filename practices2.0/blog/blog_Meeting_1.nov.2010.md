# Blog Meeting Notes - 1 . 11 . 010 #

## Erik's notes from the beginning of the session ##

logo
   top-padding of letters is too little (in bottom logo)
   echo form of cards in logo
   could be square (whilst cards should be rectangular)

cards (inspired by http://spacecollective.org)
   height should be bigger than width
   each in same size?

   Leyla's design
       Lots of space for title
       Tags are important
       possibility of fixed sized image
       first few sentence of description
       two arrows -> read more
   Same but without image
   Backside
       title, date, time, tags, nr of comments, about the author

   Users can add own image.  Thus less control of color.  Argument in favor of simple color scheme.
   Two different fonts for design.

## Logo (Marte) ##

- the number of rounded corners can reflect the cards (or not)

## Laila's Cards ##

- larger title headers in this version

### Reactions ###

- less control of the color palette of the front page when users can choose their own images
    - the rest of the coloring of the website should be _sober_/_basic_
- two different fonts for the front of the cards (title and main text needs to change)
- no author on the front---maybe not the best choice
- author bio appearing every time on the back of the card is a little overkill
    - maybe switch to "other posts by author..."
- we still have room for 'specific rollovers' (a combination of [froot.nl](http://froot.nl) and the 'related project' rollovers from [spacecollective.org](http://spacecollective.org))

## Graphic Design ##

- (Onur, Bart, John, Marte?)

- recurring themes could be color-coded
    - a line somewhere in the card
    - how many colors would these be? (list below suggests 6)
- maybe colors are not the solution. use a roll-over instead (a la spacecollective)

### Thoughts on Fonts ###

- blockquotes: less dark than the rest (perhaps offestwith a CSS background color)
- body text (p tags) could have slightly lighter color (dark grey)

- Let's use either [Google Font Directory](http://code.google.com/webfonts) or [OpenFontLibrary](http://openfontlibrary.org/) for our fonts. **No license fees!**
    - Body font: [Cantarell](http://code.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Cantarell&subset=latin) (or possibly Trebuchet)
    - Title font: doesn't _need_ to be tech-y.
        - [Jura](http://openfontlibrary.org/files/Daniel_J/98) : Medium / Demibold
        - [Pfenning](http://openfontlibrary.org/files/Daniel_J/96) : Medium
        - [Didact Gothic](http://openfontlibrary.org/files/Daniel_J/306) : Has no bold or italic variants, so might not be an option at all.
    - Perhaps incorporated somewhere---tags? blockquotes?
        - [NotCourierSans](http://openfontlibrary.org/files/ospublish/142)

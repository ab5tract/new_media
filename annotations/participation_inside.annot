Participation inside?. Mirko Tobias Schafer. Digital Materials. 2009.

Schafer's piece allows a discussion of the limits of "enthusiastic" preconceptions of participation. In outlining the explicit/implicit distinction in participation, Schafer not only outlines how channeling of user activity into implicit participation is used as a center of business models, he also problematizes explicit participation. Since Flickr as a whole has no unifying philosophy, the so-called explicit participation of uploading a photo is not necessarily such an explicit act after all. The multiplicity of uses and impulses in this system, combined with the lack of an overarching modality for that participation, means the use of 'explicit' here is not totally accurate, at least in the context of the enthusiasts' conception.

Looking at pirate assemblages through this lens of implicit/explicit participation will allow for discussing whether simply "participting" in piracy can be seen as a "resistive" act. Schafer's attitude seems to point to 'no', but this is something that needs to be investigated.

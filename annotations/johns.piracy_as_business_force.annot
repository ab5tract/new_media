Johns, Adrian. "Piracy as a Business Force." Culture Machine. Vol 10. 2009.

Johns gives an enlightening overview of the radio piracy phenomenon in the UK during the 60s, specifically focusing on the importance of Ronald Coase, Oliver Smedley, and the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA). Proposing a libertarian modality, Coase insisted that there was "no room for belief that the monopoly was necessary, inevitablee, or natural; nor for any complacency about its having been consensual at any point in its history" (50).

Johns further states: "What I am suggesting is that the moral philosophy of digital libertarianism today has a different genealogy from that usually invoked--a genealogy that leads not to Stewart Brand and ultimately John Stuart Mill, but to Oliver Smedley and Ronald Coase (and beyond them, indeed, to early radio pioneers, and even Victorian anti-patenting campaigners)" (57)

This re-positioning could have significant impacts. For instance, I was not aware of such libertarian/neo-liberal economic ties to radio piracy. By looking back at the arguments proposed against the BBC monopoly, we may be able to formulate a more distinctive and grounded critique against the monopolies of today.

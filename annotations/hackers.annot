Levy, Stephen. Hackers.

In Hackers, Stephen Levy gives the account of the history of the personal computer. Beginning with the Toy and Model Railroad Club at MIT, following along to the Homebrew Computing Club, through the 70s and 80s, Levy weaves the history of the tactical victory that is the personal computer. Developed in the first place in order to circumvent the dystopic vision of computers owned and operated only by corporations, the PC has a subversive pedigree that is rarely highlighted. By mining Levy's account, it is hoped that a more liberational understanding of the PC metamedium can be articulated. This will allow a deeper grounding for presenting computers as (potential) agents of destabilization--the potential that leads to the application of the 'piracy' label in the first place.

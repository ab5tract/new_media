Gunkel, David & Hawhee, Debra. "Virtual Alterity and the Reformatting of Ethics." Journal of Mass Media Ethics. 18(3&5), 173-193. (2003).

The positioning of communication as "perhaps the most radical of concepts" (189) through a dissent against the anthropomorphic basis of ethics provides an important angle of justification for the Abstraction. The discussion of emoticons as "the artificial warrant and gaurantee of the human" (182) is an important question when considering the construction of new symbolic gestures and grammars. Receding from relying on nominating signifiers should coincide with considered exploration into appropriate alterity signifiers. It should even be discussed whether it makes sense to strive for a non-alteric communication--instead of just falling into the continuum of culturally-bound alteric styles, perhaps it makes the most sense to reject alterity at the outset (taking cues from alterity-resistant languages along the way, if we can catch them before they die out entirely).

The juxtaposition of Deleuze and Guattari's assertion that "the face is precisely the locus of the inhuman" (180) with the facially-mediated emoticons projecting meaning (along with earnestness and sincerity, all described as "human viruses") into cyberspace--this will be a useful engagement as the rejection of nominating signifiers is itself a means to de-center the act of collaboration, and information itself, from "faces" and their attendant (in)humanity.

It is easy to appreciate their evocation of the human-as-virus memotype. "What kind of strain of the human virus does a cyber environment produce?" (174), the authors ask. The answer is, to some extent, we get to choose. There are new conceptual channels that can instantiate in the medium of a non-nominative space and any of these might be explosive enough to become popular. When we move past transmediated (textual encodings of facial communication) signals to signals that express of and within the computer medium (for instance, "computer medium" needs a new, less cumbersome, encoding).

Andersson, Jonas. Doing it for ourselves. 2009.

Andersson's essay provides important angles for investigating piracy. By critiquing the 'enthusiast' rhetoric, Andersson situates piracy in the more interesting position as a practice that has not yet but is indeed replacing old methods of distribution. It is an edge practice daily becoming more normal. Also important is the idea of _occasional activism_, which Andersson sees as enabled by P2P. Merely up or downloading by itself is not a resistive act, though it can be considered subversive. Communication and even community are not prerequisites for p2p. Furthermore, The Pirate Bay can be considered strategic, rather than tactical through the lens of de Certau.

Web 2.0 strategies are similar to what is done on the Pirate Bay, but with considerable love being shown from the capitalists. It is interesting that appropriating user contributions without pay is acceptable, but appropriating mass media objects without pay is unconscionable.

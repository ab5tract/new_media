== Disintermediation

web2.0 conceptualizes the idea of web sites that gain value by their users adding data to them.

	- but before the concept existed, it was already expressed by eBay

not easy to extract data from one site and put it in another

how do you decide which site to use?

Metcalfe proposes that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of nodes
	- this is why it is good that there is only one "email", one "web"; contrasted to IM

machine readable web pages

"we could create a Metcalfe law for data"

put everything on your own page

Web 2.0 is damaging to the Web by dividing it into topiclal subwebs

== Semantic Search for Europeana

Europeana:
	- connnecting to European  cultural heritage
	- access to digital content and descriptions

Larg Eggort::
	- now 50 providers
	- target for 2010: 10 million objects
	
Basic idea is to use metadata from content providers

semantics ae already there, in metadata and "controlled vocabularies" used in metadata

semantics ain't easy


== why the world wide web is broken

search is a key function for connecting the medium of databases
	- "search is everywhere"

to talk (only) about Google at Society of the Query is like only talking about Windows at an OS conference

folksonomy - unstructured and limited to their respective walled garden

a controlled vocabulary in the semantic web is called an "ontology"
	- periodic table is an "ontology"

tree taxonomies - starting with Aristotle's "theory of categories"

encyclopedia (alphabetical ordering) vs. tree taxonomy

Clay Shirky - "Ontology is Overrated"

onotologies make ideological statements

metadata is prone to spamming

semantic will not work without trust

it will make the search engines even stronger

Critiques of web:
  - not designed with full text search in mind
	- URL structure is too linked to structure/file system location of servers; too volatile

the web has moved from "pages" to a real-time / multimedia system

Proposals:
	- the hash checksum for files; find files by checksum rather than URL
	- revision monitoring
  - full text index of the web (public) "everyone can build their own search engine"

Perhaps it is time to leave the world wide web to the cognitive capitalists and develop a system that makes their services unnecessary

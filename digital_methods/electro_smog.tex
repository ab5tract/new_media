\section[intro]{Introduction}

Economics has never been about empowering the people. Neither has it ever been about sustainability. In fact, `sustainable immobility' is an oxymoron. The transition from migratory culture to the city-state removed sustainability as a constraint on human population size. No longer dependent on natural ecosystems and th mobility that formed the only means of having food to eat throughout the year, the city-state defines civilized life as a form of unsustainable immobility that applies equally the same today.

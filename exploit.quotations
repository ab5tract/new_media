"we maintain that in recent decades the processes of globalization have mutated from a system of control housed in a relatively smallnumber of power hubs to a system of control infused into the material fabric of distributed networks." (p. 3)
	- the network form emerges as dominant because the solutions to protecting both the biological and electronic networks reside on the same network; thus, networking emerges as the dominant form of describing control (and resistence)

"Instead we want to suggest that _the juncture between sovereignty and networks_ is the place where the apparent contradictinons in which we live can be best understood." (p. 5)

- they characterize the network form as "bent on eradicating the importance of any distinct or individual node"

"even while networks are entirely coincident with social life, networks also carry with them the most nonhuman and misanthropic tendencies." (p. 6)
	- example of the mob, viruses: _networks that work too well_

"Any instance of naming always produces its shadowy double: nominalism, that is, the notion that universal descriptors do not adequetely represent the referents they are supposed to name or demarcate." (p 11)
	"Can a network ever be "faced" without also being named?"

"By 'thinking topologically,' we mean an approach that compares the abstract spaces of different structural or architectonic systems. Pyramidal hierarchy and distributed networks, for example, have two different topologies of organization and control." (p. 13) 

"Asymmetry -- the diagram is the tactic." (p. 14)
	- "roughly concurrent" with postmodernism
		"postmodernity is characterized by frictions between structurally incommensurate political diagrams, where ultimately one is leveraged at the expense of the other (and something altogether different comes out the other end).
	"the high modern mode of political conflict is characterized by symmetricl war" (p. 15)
  "after the postmodern mode of asymmetrical political conflict ... we recognize in recent years the emergencce of a new politics of symmetry" (p. 15)

- networks act politically: Rogue Swarms and Mainframe Grids

"Whereas in former times, during the late modern era of the Cold War, for example, connectivity served to deaden the threat of weaponry and other forms of conflict--open up _channels_ of communication with the Soviets, _engage_ with China--today connectivity functions in exactly the opposite way." (16)

"Connectivity is a threat. The network is a weapons system." 16
	- so-classified by the US military

"We mean that the West created terrorism in the same way that the overprescription of antibiotics creates new bacterial resistances." 17

"As heterogeneity disappears, difference becomes all the more radical." 17

"from a certain perspective, networks are _internally_ asymmetrical" 18

"In being additive, networks necessarily establish unequal power differentials within their very structures." 18

- not all networks are built the same; networking does not imply a preference for the distributed mode

"Networked power is based on a dialectic between two opposing tendencies: one radically distributes control into autonomous locales; the other focuses control into rigidly defined hierarchies." 19

- "global-single" command events and MetaLog

"the exploit" -- a resonant flaw designed to resist, threaten, and ultimately desert the dominant political diagram

"Networks exist in a new kind of global universalism, but one coextensive with a permanent state of internal inconsistency and exceptionalism." 22

- antiweb / exceptional topology

== Multiplicity

- long, but perhapsmost concise statement of what 'protocol' is. 58



"multiplicity is how the network is able to handle sudden, unplanned, or localized changes within itself." 61 

== Defacement of Enmity

"Enmity is an interface." 65

"the topologies of netwar and the 'multitude' throw up a challenge to traditional notions of enmity: they have no face; they are instances of faceless enmity." 66

military topologies: chaotic melee, brute-force massing, complex maneuvers, and swarming 67
	- swarming: amorphous yet coordinated 68

"If there is no foe to face, how does one face a foe?" 68
	"It is not so much that the foe has a face, but that the foe is faced, that 'facing' is a process, a verb, an action in the making." 68

"Again the point is not faciality--or choesion, or integrity, or singularity, or what have you--is the sole prerequisite for affective control or organization, for indeed the sarm has significant power even before it facializes, but that faciality s a particular instance of organization, one that the swarm may or may not coalesce around." 69

== The Exploit

"Yet within protocological networks, political acts generally happen not by shifting power from one place to another but by exploiting power differentials already existing in the system." 81
	- the power differential inherent in the multitude: it is the choices, however programmed, that the multitude makes that determine what is valued as cultural currency

"Protocological struggles do not center around changing existent technologies but instead involve discovering holes in existent technologies and projecting potential change through those holes." 81
	- the question of whether identity escrow is a protocological struggle or not

"We stress that the viral perspective works through replication _and_ cryptography, a conjunction of two procedures." 86
	- quite a bit like the escrow exploit

"Viruses and diseases are obviously not to be looked at as models for progressive political action. But it is precisely in their ambivalent politics that we see both the plasticity and the fragility of control in networks." 96

"In this way, networks fail only when they succeed. Networks cultivate the flood, but the flood is what can take down the network." 96
	- similar to capitalism sowing the seeds of its own destruction

"definition of the exploit as an abstract machine"
	"_Vector:_ The exploit requires an orgnic or inorganic in which there exists some form of action or motion"
	"_Flaw:_ The exploit requires a set of vulnerabilities in a network that allow the vector to be logically accessible. These vulnerabilities are also the network's conditions for realization, its becoming-unhuman."
	"_Transgression:_ The exploit creates a shift in the ontology of the network, in which the 'failure' of the network is in fact a change in its topology (for example, from centralized to distributed)." 97

== Counterprotocol

"First, oppositional practices will have to focus not on a static map of one-to-one relationships but on a dynamic diagram of many-to-many relationships." 98

"These practices will have to attend to many-to-many relationships without making the dangerous mistake of thinking that many-to-many means total or universal." 98
	- "This means that _the counterprotocols of current networks will be pliant and vigorous_ where existing protocols are flexible and robust." 98

"The second point is about tactics. In reality counterprotocological practice is not 'counter' anything." 98

"There are two directions for political change: resistance implies a desire for stasis or retrograde motion, but hypertrophy is the desire for pushing beyond." 98
	- pushing technology "further than it was meant to go" 98

"The third point has to do with structure. Because networks are (technically) predicated on creating possible communications between nodes, oppositional practices will have to focus less on the characteristics of the nodes and more on the quality of the interactions between nodes." 99

"Nodes will be constructed as a by-product of the creation of edges, and edges will be a precondition for the inclusion of nodes in a network." 99

Deleuze: "Practice is a set of relays from one theoretical point to another. No theory develops without eventually encountering a wall, and practice is necessary for piercing this wall." 100

"Because a network is as much a technical system as a political one, any theory addressing networks will have to entertain a willingness to theorize at the technical level." 100


== Two-way communications

"the past as _less_ repressive from the perspective of informatic media. Television was a huge megaphone. The Internet is a high-bandwidth security camera." 124

"We are nostalgic, then, for a time _when organisms didn't need to produce quantitative data about themselves_, for a time when one didn't need to report back." 124
	- a hint at what they want from 'nonexistence'

"_Instead of the open/closed opposition, we suggest an examination of the alternative logics of control_." 125


== Universals of Identification

"As a political program, this means that communications protocols are _technologies of conservative absorption. They are algorithms for translating the liberal into the conservative. And today the world's adoption of universal communications protocols is nearing completion, just as the rigid austerity measuresof neoliberal capitalism have absorbed all global markets." 131

"The twentieth century will be remembered as the last time there existed non-media. In the future there will be a coincidence between happening and storage." 132

== Tactics of Nonexistence

- shining a laser into the eye of a camera; there but not represented
- "one might go online but trick the server into recording a routine event" 135

"One's data is there, but it keeps moving, of its own accord, in its own temporary autonomous ecology." 135

"Nonexistence is nonexistence not because it is an absence, or because it is not visible, but precisely because it is full." 136

"When existence becomes a measurable science of control, then nonexistence must become a tactic for any thing wishing to avoid control." 136

"A driven exodus or a pointless desertion are equally virtuous in the quest for noneistence." 136

"The nonexistent is that which cannot be parsed by any available algorithms." 137
                          
== Disappearance, or I've Seen it All Before

the challenge is "a challenge of existence without representation (or at least existence that abandons representation, a non-existence, an a-existence)." 138

== There Is No Content

"Meaning is a data conversion." (145)

"Content, then, is to be understood as the relationship that exists between specific technologies. Content, if it exists, happens when this relationship is solidified, made predictable, institutionalized, and mobilized." 145

== The User and the Programmer

"Freedom of expresssion is no longer relevant; freedom of use has taken its place." 143

== Coda

Hardt and Negri: "The multitude, by contrast, is not unified but remains plural and multiple...The multitude is composed of a set of singuarities--and b singularity here we mean a social subjct whose difference cannot be reduced to sameness, a difference that remains different." 150

"the materiality of networks...exhibits power relations regardless of powerful individuals." 153

"We suggest that discussions of the multitude, netwars, and networks are really discussions about the unhuman within the human." 154

- protocol is physics

"Networks, generally speaking, show us the unhuman in the human, that the individuated human subject is not the basic unit of constitution but a myriad of information, affects, and matters." 155

"In a sense, therefore, our understanding of networks is _all-too-human_..." 157

== Liberated Computer Language

they curiously choose to work harder to bring the human more fully into the network; rather than proposing new language (ideally symbolic) to describe unhuman characteristics

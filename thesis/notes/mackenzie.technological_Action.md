From Simondon's standpoint, technological action as abstraction arises from a particular relation that something living creates to something external to itself, 'the ensemble' of technical objects. In making this relation, the technological action changes not only the ensemble, but also the form of life of its agent. Abstraction comes into being and begins to subsume or reconfigure existing relations between inside and outside. Retroactoin links not-yet individuated fields of potentials to existing structures, forms and matters. (Mackenzie 2006: 203)

Abstraction here is "an embodied, corporeal and collectively energised transformation" (Mackenzie 2006: 203). Mackenzie gives computer cases as an example of an abstraction. Though the components have standardized as a result of their commodification, their very variety and variability

Technological actions concretise an abstract aspect of the ensemble by altering relations between the sub-ensembles, either by adding something that diminishes their incompatibilities or inconsistencies or by resituating technological objects in their environments. (Mackenzie 2006: 205)

"To varying degrees, a technological action participates in a becoming or event that restructures a domain." (Mackenzie 2006: 208).

"Technological actions activate, in highly temporally complex ways, the potentials of the pre-individuated realities that comprise collective life." (Mackenzie 2006:  209)

Technological actions is 'connective,' "it does something to the extent that it stages encounters with other realities through the reticulations it draws out." (209)

According to the account of technological action developed here, technological actions have no pre-constituted observers. If we think of technological action as a process of abstraction and concretisation that responds to a situation by individuating, thought itself cannot actually respond to that situation without also individuating. Thinking is a process of individuation and begins to belong to the domain in question in the same way that technological action does." (210)

On occations when it overflows norms of work or consumption, technological action allows an individual to glimpse their own actions outside any framing by social function or norms. This becoming transforms them into a mediator, site of co-invention of the situation and language. (210-211)

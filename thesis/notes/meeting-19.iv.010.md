# Week 3 - The Happening of A Relative Absence #
## Meeting 19 . iv . 010 ##

1. investigating mediums is done by examining qualities/properties
	- by looking at the formats it "hosts" (how to pick that verb?)

2. how to study media
	- definitional step (properties)
	- Manovich: computer complicates medium understanding, mking it no longer so easy just to define media strictly by their properties
		- becomes focused on input and output
	- chronological order of theory?
		- Mcluhand -> Bolter -> Hayles -> Manovich
	- media through McLuhan: based on sensory captivation; "effects" analysis

3. how to treat computer typography
	- what is the relationship between medium analysis and computer typography?
	- is it a medium?
	- cross-media challenge
		- transmedia? 
		- transference (a cross-media strategy)
		- there could be other approaches
		- "one could evaluate various strategies for moving to the screen in terms of media theory."
			- is it a remediation problem? cross-media problem? does the problem go away if looked at in a different sense, a la transmedia?
		- what can theory do?
			- reformulate the problem in ways that lead to more productive work in that area
			- can theory help redefine or reposition the problem with computer typography?



## TODO ##

- read up 'genres'
	- 'genres' vs 'formats' ?
	- van der Pol teaches a whole genre theory class
- cross-formats? (can formats be found in other formats a la Hayles?)
- cross-media / transmedia (Jenkins)
	- same story vs story segmented across media

- the complicated nature of typography can be seen as through remediation?

- Nature of the problem??
	- classic problems of conversion 
		- Mars rover metric vs english
	- the *reason* to go to media theory

- what are the mmost obvious ways of studying this?
	- make the point for introucing another point of view
	- how is it researched normally

# Digital Code and Literary Text #
## Florian Cramer ##

"Perhaps the term of digital “multimedia” – or better: “intermedia” – would be more helpful if we redeﬁne it as _the possibility to losslessly translate information from one sign system to the other, forth and back, so that the visible, audible or tacticle representation of the information becomes arbitrary._" (4)

"The alphabet of both machine and human language is interchangeable, so that “text” – if deﬁned as a countable mass of alphabetical signiﬁers – remains a valid descriptor for both machine code sequences and human writing. In syntax and semantics however, machine code and human writing are not interchangeable. Computer algorithms are, like logical statements, a formal language and thus only a restrained subset of language as a whole." (5)

# Volume One: The Early Years #

the punch card was:
- memory
- storage
- archive
- network
- user interface

mainframes and the stored program concept--program and data held within the same memory (no more programming with wires)
	- use the Ornstein quote!

the division of labor between analyst, programmer, and keypuncher (Ornstein quote about underpaid women)

batch - optimize machine time, not human time 
timesharing - optimize for programmer time

paper tape was even harder than punchcards, because 
	- (origin of backspace and delete keys)
	- best parity of accessibility between blind and non-blind people ("After this point, everything I am about to say works against them [blind people]")

biggest argument for batch was "discipline"
	- Crockford sees this as a running thread in programming history
	- an "example of a technology developed by programmers, for programmers" without a coherent argument for their rejection

timesharing opened the space for all the social applications (file sharing, email, chat, open source development)

text editors appear in timesharing as well, editors on the teletype

Runoff -> Scribe -> GML -> SGML -> HTML

"Unhealthy separation of structure and presentation"

"Long, fragile lists of self-contradictory rules."

Small, rigid set of tags results in 'overloading' that must be solved later in CSS.

Crockford says that the "Web would have been replaced already" if its only elements were CSS and HTML. The process by which these two elements were able to succeed is JavaScript.

	  >&quot;Whenever information flows between two differently embodied entities---for example, sound wave and microphone or microphone and recording device---analogue resemblance is likely to come into play because it allows one form of continuously varying information to be translated into a similarly shaped informational pattern in another medium.&quot; (77)</p

	><p
	  >&quot;They [two e-text authors] refuse the distinction between writing that appears on the screen as the 'real' cretice effort, because they deeply understand, through their own creative practices, that screenic text and programming are logically, conceptually, and instrumentally entwined.&quot; (80)</p

	  >&quot;Books also create rich cognitive environments, but they passively embody the cognitions of writer, reader, and book designer rather than actively participate in cognition themselves.&quot; (84)</p

	  >&quot;Rooted in the Cartesian tradition, this ideology also betrays a class and economic division between the work of creation---the privileged activity of the author as inspired genius---and the work of producing the book as a physical artifact, an activity relegated to publishers and booksellers.&quot; (86)</p

	>&quot;Nineteenth- cenutry typogrphy has commonly been characterized in terms of loss of standards under thepressures of industrialization, and then regeneraion...Any examination of the question of what was modern in nineteenth-century typography must include both technical and stylistic changes, but there are other factors too. A consideration of these other aspects, especially of attempts to describe and rationalize typography, suggests that the story of decline and regeneration is too simple.&quot; (34)</li

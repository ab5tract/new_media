# Thesis Chapter List #

1. Introduction
	- Re-mediation
	- Historical developments of the various formats (Typewriter -> Word, SGML -> HTML, Typesetting math -> TeX)
	- Contrast the approaches: WYSIWYG, semantic markup, formal markup
	
2. A history of cross-media publishing and generative design
	- History of the term 'media,' it's origins in advertising as they developed a language to discuss 'mediating' messages, that is, tailoring the message to suit a particular 'medium'
	- Advantages and disadvantages of generative design.
		- Issues of scale can considerably affect the suitability of a generative workflow over a traditional one.
	- The Holy Grail: "one system that serves as the universal document source"
		- Resembles other holy grails, "artificial intelligence" and "real-time collaborative editing of the same document"
	- Wrappers: software for remediating formats 
	- Showstoppers: errors and/or limitations in functionality that force abandoning one approach for another
	- The role of FLOSS in generative design
	
3. Approaches to digital typesetting
	- WYSIWYG: the computer as a typewriter
		- Concrete poetry and "free form typography" as unique to this approach.
	- Semantic markup: interpreted plaintext (top-down)
		- Tuned for remediation, strict separation of display from content.
	- Formal markup: the document typesets itself (bottom-up)
		- The long and varied history of TeX.
		- Why ConTeXt?

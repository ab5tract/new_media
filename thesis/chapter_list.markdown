# Thesis Chapter List #

1. Introduction
	- Re-mediation: the drive towards "greater authenticity and immediacy of presentation" (Bolter 2001: 70)
	- Historical developments of the various formats (Typewriter -> Word, SGML -> HTML, Typesetting math -> TeX)
	- Contrast the approaches: WYSIWYG, semantic markup, formal markup
	- the relationship between computers and language (Cramer 2001)
		- computers run on alphabets; "Literature is therefore a privileged symbolic form in digital information systems." (Cramer 2001: 2)
		- the rule of searching for a specific text phrase is complicated by formats: intermediate layers are required for text searching when ODT/PDF are involved
	- the re-remediation of Project Gutenberg: the availability of ASCII (itself a remdiation) allows for translation across interfaces; the appearance of the tablets/e-readers as interfaces to the ASCII re-mediates them back into a book
	
2. A history of cross-media publishing and generative design
	- Simondon's _transduction_: "By transduction we mean an operation--physical, biological, mental, social--by which an activity propagates itself from one element to the next, within a given domain, and founds this propagation on a structuration of the domain that is realized from place to place: each area of the constituted structures serves as the principle and the model of the next area, as a primer for its constitution, to the extent that the modification expands progressibely at the same time as the structuring operation" (Simondon 2009: 11).
		- the "pre-format" as preindividual (but still individual); ontologies on top of ontologies
	- History of the term 'media,' it's origins in advertising as they developed a language to discuss 'mediating' messages, that is, tailoring the message to suit a particular 'medium'
	- Advantages and disadvantages of generative design.
		- Issues of scale can considerably affect the suitability of a generative workflow over a traditional one.
	- The Holy Grail: "one system that serves as the universal document source"
		- Resembles other holy grails, "artificial intelligence" and "real-time collaborative editing of the same document"
	- Wrappers: software for remediating formats 
		- the ultimate intersection point
	- Showstoppers: errors and/or limitations in functionality that force abandoning one approach for another
		- limitations of bibliographic intersections
	- The role of FLOSS in generative design
	- bootstrapping - Engelbart's idea of using computer tools to make better computer tools
	
3. Approaches to digital typesetting
	- Print is Static, Code is Process: the physics of text
		- Hayles requests taking into account physical specificity; the last chapter will include memory heap visualizations in order to interrogate the utility of such an approach
			- what about the physicality of the writer in crafting the text? this leads directly into questions of workflow
	- WYSIWYG: the computer as a typewriter
		- Concrete poetry and "free form typography" as unique to this approach.
		- "A typewriter (or a computer-drive printer of the same quality) that justifies its lines in imitation of typesetting is a presumptious, uneducated machine, mimicking the outward form instead of the inner truth of typography." (Bringhurst 2008: 28) 
	- Semantic markup: interpreted plaintext (top-down)
		- Tuned for remediation, strict separation of display from content.
	- Formal markup: the document typesets itself (bottom-up)
		- The long and varied history of TeX.
		- Why ConTeXt?

4. A Generative Methodology
	- Is this process useful? Does such a practical approach have anything to offer theory? And does theory offer anything useful for the practice?
	- Visualizations: memory heap analysis (again, is it useful? does it map a 'materiality'?)
		- also, version control visualizations of the git repository that hosts the thesis files
	- Case studies
		- HTML
		- OpenOffice.org
		- ConTeXt

Hello Femke,

My name is John Haltiwanger. I am a masters student in new media at the Universiteit van Amsterdam currently working on a thesis examining generative design and typesetting wth free softwre. Naturally when I begin asking people like Geert Lovink and Florian Cramer about these issues, the name Open Source Publishers is raised at least once in a conversation.

I was hoping that you might have time to meet with me to discuss OSP's experience in the open source publishing world. For instance, I have read the essay regarding your experience with ConTeXt. This is extremely interesting to me as that macro package is on of three output formats I will be concurrently typesetting my thesis in---that is, the case study of the thesis is the thesis itself being typeset in HTML, ODT, and ConTeXt. I would very much appreciate getting to know more about the limitations you've run into in your experience with ConTeXt so far, i.e. specific typographical operations, unfulfillable design dreams, etc. Not to mention what you _were_ able to accomplish. Do you perhaps have time to meet with me in Brussels at some point in the next few weeks?  

Sincerely,
John C Haltiwanger

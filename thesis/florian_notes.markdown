# Notes with Florian #

1. Fundamental engineering difference between ConTeXt 
	- no real formal document declaration
	- not a semantic markup language, based on macros
	- TeX is bottom-up, versus semantic (top down)
	- Jade transformer takes XML and SGML into a plain TeX document

2. pandoc is a wrapper
	- look into alternatives
	- least common denomitor
	- resembles natural languages in that translations are 'lossy'
	- post-design processes
	- proprietary options?
		- Woodwing: developing similar systems, SmartBooks
		
3. cross-media publishing
	- nearly an artificial intelligence problematic
	- point of departure: why do have to start from scratch for all these different output formats?
	- unpredictability

4. generative typographic design
	- Conditional Design manifesto
	- Luna Maurer, Roel Wouters, Jonathan Puckey (Amsterdam)
	- LUST
	- catalogtree (Rotterdam and Arnhem)
	- OS Publishing (Open Source Publishing, Brussels)
		- Femke Snelting (uses ConTeXt)
	- Scriptographer
	- exhibition in Breda: Info Deco Data
	- Petr van Blokland
		- "In our office we no longer use Adobe products, we program everything."
		- house designer of Rabobank
	- Open
	
6. wrappers on top of wrappers
	- error handling
	
7. ODT does not live up to its promise
	- DocBook: most robust XML format
	- TEI (Text Encoding Initiative): for electronic philology
	- Word is a good point for re-mediation, as it was meant to emulate the typewriter.
		- typewriters are not document creation (typesetting) systems
		- literal WYSIWYG
		- allows visual poetry that is not possible elsewhere
		- "free form typography," creating a text visually
		- per-line breaking

8. constant back and forth between ease of use vs robustness
	- same problem as exists for semantic web
	- 

9. We have hit the limits of WYSIWYG, and designers are realizing this.
	- TexMacs: WYSIWYG
	
10. J David Bolter: re-mediation. hypertext/hypermedia. Grousin. _Re-mediation_.
	- the new medium holds the old medium, the old medium changes to fit the new
	- Michael Heim. _Electric Language_.
		- how word processing changes writing
	
11. pandoc is not a heterarchy, but a hierarchy, with pandoc on top
	- 'media' was born in advertising in the 1940s
		- which medium is appropriate for the message,how do you mediate that message in transferring it to medium
	- pandoc works in this classical media way, addressing concerns of mediating the message into various mediums
		- text-to-speech, morse code, etc.
	- issues of scale: programming can be an inefficient solution

12. TeX limitations
	- no color separation
	- "showstoppers"

13. Adobe has developed an XML format for InDesign; can generate programmitically
	- in FLOSS, generate SVG. 
	
14. Distributed authorship, open source, to design and art.
	- the system most used at this point is Drupal
	- FLOSS Manuals uses Drupal and htmldoc for printable documents.
		- pragmatic

15. relating to theory: intermediation/re-mediation
	- look into case examples of unfulfilled promises of computer technology
		- Xanadu
	- in the 70s it seemed like document transformation was basic; then you look at the intricacies. even simple user scenarios tap into the problem of what a computer can and can't do; let alone what a user can and can't do.
	
16. music vs texts
	- music is not semantic
	- no one expects a computer to produce music with a perfect voice; the expectation is something of its own
	- yet with text, we have the expectation of reading text typeset in the same way as it is by hand
	- perhaps an aesthetic difference: we don't expect electronic music to sound like analog; 
	
17. Readability
	- TeX comes close, but 
	- player piano vs a real pianist == TeX vs a WYSIWYG enabled typographer
	- there is no good kerning algorithm
		- why is text so difficult to create aesthetically?

18. Broaden perspective and see what else is going on in cross-media publishing
	- media theory
	- perhaps ANT works but it doesn't come out clearly in the proposal
	- focus on one theory that gets to where we want to go
	- core analysis of the discussion, stick to one or two theories

19. Holy Grail: one system that serves as the universal document source. 
	- in the end it might be many holy grails, one for each type of documents
	- can you reach the Holy Grail without complexity making it unworkable?

# nettime eXtrapolation Syntax #

## A proposal to up the game. ##

Turn emails into beautiful presentation of concepts in text.

There can be one input that generates many outputs. Evaluate quality based on ease of accessibility. Eyes matter, but the way a text is perceived matters more.

Eat plain-text with crowdsourcing and turn all archived classics into new Materials.

_If I sound ambitious, its because the software is all there to turn this into reality. More important than available toolsets, then, is_ Motivation.

Halfway to four 'M's, then, I'll re-iterate the importance of More. All of life is the product of over abundance, so it seems stupid to deny one the right to be many, in whatever pieces seem necessary.

Because the only thing missing is a proper bibliographic standard, defer to the least surprising available standard (CSL?) but aim for the driving of the best (RDFa).

Where a resource differs, a resource forks. Allow a standard syntactical interface to provide access to things such as 'opposite', 'refutation', and 'analogous'.[^1] Anyone can contribute connections. 

Mobility, is the rounding out word, heretofore delivered before More, but comprising the hidden capacity of Four. Let's numerologize on our way to somewhere different. It's going to take a standard way of talking with one another. Don't let the old legends of a scournful diety deter you---this quest is not only righteous but ancient, and necessary at the level of the contemporary. We can speak the same language again.

Texts should always be attached to links not necessarily of the originators' choosing. This is called Vocal Democracy. An Equal Opportunity for Voices, embedded because it is already present in human sociality. Let the assemblage reflect itself. [^2]

But most importantly, integrate cleanly with plaintext. It's more than a motto, it's a question of Mobility. Never get caught pants down with a binary format in a land without translators.

In other words, thank god for open source. Thank God for the urge for Freedom. That, ultimately, is the difference---for one morality comes with a lower-case 'm'.

Because if there is nothing besides the consciousness inside you, your definitions of what is necessary are necessarily skewed. So, I'd expect, is the lot of all of us.

This cyberspace was always a land of words. It's time we typeset it properly. Let's let our words speak as loudly as the medium will let us. Never in some back alley mail archive typewriter font, unless that's the way they request it. And in that case, for the audience, it's the best possible way to look good.

Which brings us back to the realm of the Material. Manifested through a web application that translates the document into _whatever format you have requested_, this document is electronically prepared for your mind. 

Never forget that a screen and a sheet are different. The best texts account for both. That's why we provide an easy option to print something else than plaintext. Not just something else, but something suitable for the saturation of tree carcass in ink symbols.[^3]

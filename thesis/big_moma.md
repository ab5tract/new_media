# Introduction #

This thesis is an attempt to interrogate current new media theories through a practice-based, process-oriented approach. The point of origin is that the screen. Information transmission is increasingly screen-based, a fact that only intensifies with the increasing ubiquity of mobile devices such as the iPhone. The long-awaited advent of cheap "tablet" computers and e-readers is also now at hand. These devices may all be seen as mediums for _screenic processes_ in that their entire configuration and all of its computation exists to serve as the basis for screenic interactions with _human processes_. These phrasings introduce the perceptual angle attendent with this thesis, namely the centering of _process_ as the atomic unit of what is discussed in new media theory. The term _screenic_ simply means 'screen-based,' or perhaps 'screen-native.' It is analagous to 'printed.'

Screens are defined first and foremost by their interactivity. Some screens, such as television screens, offer very limited interactivity: the choice of content. This choice itself can be constrained by varying degrees, such as the number of available channels and playback formats (VHS, DVD, Xvid, etc.), even to the point of disappearing (in the case of many televisions that appear in public spaces).[^1] The medium of the remote control should not be underestimated in its effects on human processes, to say nothing of the screens at which they are aimed. Indeed, they drive the interactivity of the video game consoles, an interactivity that clearly represents the cultural cutting edge of what a television screen can offer.

[^1]: Mobile devices are beginning to ship IR transeivers with full hardware access through software. That is, the _entire potential_ of the IR spectrum is available to them.

The computer screen, on the other hand, is defined by its seemingly limitless degree of interactivity. Remote controls can be run as screenic processes and can not only change television channels--processes on remote systems can be controlled with similar ease. Indeed, the entire screenic composition of one computer can be controlled over a network by a second computer using included, or easy to obtain, applications. Typically the only element of a computer screen that the user does not effectively control are the structure and visual language of an operating system's graphical user interface (GUI). Even this, however, is generally accomplishable by a significantly informed user. In the case of GNU/Linux the task is not only accomplishable: in the case of a "from scratch" installation,[^1] the user is literally forced to make a choice of GUI structure and visual styling. Microsoft has generally shipped their operating systems with multiple choices for widget[^2] presentation, including re-mediations of widgets from previous versions of Windows. Users also developed  Apple, however, maintains strict control of widget presentation, especially on their mobile devices.

[^1]: Such as is demanded by no-frills distributions such as Gentoo and ArchLinux, where manual installation and configuration of a GUI is required for use.
[^2]: A widget is the technical term for a GUI element. Scrollbars, titlebars, menus, and close/minimize/maximize buttons are widgets attached to most of the "windows" that appears on any given GUI-driven computer.

To discuss computer screens one must necessarily engage with the concept of _interface_, a topic that rightfully occupies a great deal of current new media discourse. Interface, then, represents one point of departure from our origin. While interfaces often utilize many visual metaphors (most of them inherited from the work done developing the first GUI at Xerox's Palo Alto Advanced Research Lab (PARC) in the 1970s), there are yet few computer interfaces that do not rely on text as their dominant mechanism for organizing and presenting a program's internal capabilities to a user. (Mobile screens, on the other hand, increasingly display developing trends of icon-only design, though the web browser remains a popular application). Despite the success of the GUI over the text-only command-line interface (CLI), then, text remains central to contemporary experiences of computer screens.

The centrality of text to the experience of computer screens represents the main avenue by which we proceed from the origin, constituting a trunk from which many additional concerns fork away and then face examination. The arguments of the paper are augmented by the inclusion of a historiography of digital typesetting. Engaging critically with the history of _software itself_ is proposed as a requisite for responsible software studies.

Another branching element of this thesis, one that runs throughout the entirety of itself, is the underlying presentation of the text. Through the utilization of FLoSS software, multiple output formats will be not only be investigated but also materially instantiated. These output formats represent the top three (open) interfaces currently used to manage and display texts digitally: HTML, PDF and OpenOffice.org's ODT.(!RERE!) 

The process(es) of their generation offers an attempt at mapping Gilbert Simondon's language of ontogenesis onto file format translation or, to begin the project immediately, _individuation_. Coupled with Simondon's individuation is the concept of _transduction_, which concerns itself with the nature of change. 

This elate with the increasingly generative nature of contemporary design.  All of which are generated from a plain-text file whose syntax conforms to a format standard called 'markdown.' 

The polycephalous nature of _the text itself_ thus demands further branching into a discussion of formats. What are the attributes of the class of process to which formats belong? Formats are seen as stable, yet they move like glass (or glaciar) in the nano-magnitudes of the digital. 

The discussion of generativity is thus partially an attempt to parallelize human and digital processes. Analyzed materially, these processes are chunks of code electronically lifted from hard drive platters, loaded into system memory, and then executed via the assemblage of chips on the computer's motherboard by way of instructions from the operating system currently residing as a mass of memory heaps in RAM chips. Analyzed _processually_, however, these digital processes are properly seen as deriving from interactions with human beings. That is to say, digital and human processes are intimately intertwined, from the design of their physical landscape of execution (microcircuitry) to the instructions derived from the user. From a process angle the computer becomes something of an external nervous system, extending and modifying the realm of human potentiality even as it surpasses the capacity of a single mind to functionally comprehend the entirety of its workings.[^	1]

## Remote Controls, or: the Epitome of Cool Media? ##

Is it possible to take the remote control and use it to create a metaphor for all human-computer interaction? 

## Recognizing the Ontogenesis in Generativity ##

In his text _The Position of the Problem of Ontogenesis_ (written in (!CITE!) but only recently translated into English), Simondon writes,

  By transduction we mean an operation--physical, biological, mental, social--by which an activity propagates itself from one element to the next, within a given domain,  and founds this propagation on a structuration of the domain that is realized from place to place: each area of the constituted structure serves as the principle and the model for the next area, as a primer for its constitution, to the extent that the modification expands progresively at the same time as the structuring operation. (Simondon 2009: 11)

## Attributes of Process ##

Process is reflective. It's outputs reflect its inputs. Additionally, process affects the metapotential in a given system. It's reflectivity, then, has material effect. As it reflects the inputs into the outputs, the outputs in turn reflect new (or else simply different) potentials back into the landscape which receives input.

# Introduction #

This thesis is an attempt to grapple with multiple issues facing the field of new media studies. The point of origin, from which I will make several departures, is that of the screen. Mediation is increasingly screen-based, a fact that only intensifies with the increasing ubiquity of mobile devices as well as the long-awaited advent of cheap "tablet" computers.

Screens are defined first and foremost by their interactivity. Some screens, such as television screens, offer very limited interactivity: the choice of content. This choice itself can be constrained by varying degrees, such as the number of available channels and playback formats (VHS, DVD, Xvid, etc.), even to the point of disappearing (in the case of many televisions that appear in public spaces).

The computer screen, however, is defined by its seemingly limitless degree of interactivity. Typically the only element of a computer screen that the user does not effectively control are the structure and visual language of an operating system's graphical user interface (GUI). Even this, however, is generally accomplishable by a significantly informed user. In the case of GNU/Linux the task is not only accomplishable: in the case of a "from scratch" installation,[^1] the user is forced to make a choice of GUI structure and visual styling.

[^1]: Such as is demanded by no-frills distributions such as Gentoo and ArchLinux, where manual installation and configuration of a GUI is required.

To discuss computer screens, then, one must engage with the concept of _interface_, a topic that rightfully occupies a great deal of current new media discourse. Interface, then, represents one point of departure from our origin. While interfaces often utilize many visual metaphors (most of them inherited from the work done developing the first GUI at Xerox's Palo Alto Advanced Research Lab (PARC) in the 1970s), there are yet few interfaces that do not rely on text as their dominant mechanism for organizing and presenting a program's internal capabilities to a user. Despite the success of the GUI over the text-only command-line interface (CLI), then, text remains central to contemporary experiences of computer screens.

The centrality of text to the experience of computer screens represents the main point of departure from the origin, constituting a trunk from which many additional concerns fork away and then face examination. One element of this thesis that runs the entirety of that trunk is the underlying presentation of the text in multiple output formats, all of which are generated from a plain-text file written in what can only be considered an input format. The polycephalous nature of _the text itself_ thus demands further branching into discussions of formats and generativity. Both of these topics raise questions relating to the capacities of current new media theory to discuss and interrogate real processes that new media deploy.

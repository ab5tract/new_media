# Generative design

Generative practices increasingly take a larger prominence in
design workflows. "The process is the product," declares the
*Conditional Design Manifesto*. Employing the
"methods of philosophers, engineers, inventors and mystics," the
four authors of the manifesto seek to abandon the idea of a product
in favor of
"things that adapt to their environment, emphasize change and show difference"
(Maurer, et al.). The text is split into a prose introduction and
three sections of manifesto-like declarative sentences:

The powerful Java-platform tool named Processing has become wildly
popular amongst visualization designers. The demo scene has long
employed generative techniques to instantiate complexity on-screen
using as few as 4 kilobytes of compiled binary code.

The case study at the core of this paper will explore these
concerns as the materiality of the thesis itself remains ethereal.
It is more than its input, it is more than its output: it is
literally and figuratively very much a *process*.

The substrate of the text you are reading right now is a simple
formal markup language called Markdown. Originally written in Perl,
it has spread to any language that ends up touching the web. This
is due to its popularity as an approachable 'pre-formatting' markup
language for operations such as blog posts and comments, where HTML
is the desired output but a simpler *and more readable* input is
often preferrable.

# Theoretical Perspectives

In his piece "Media Cold and Hot", Marshall McCluhan argues that a
medium's capacity to capture.

# Materialist Format Analysis

One of the primary objectives of this paper is to force integration
of typographical design principles into a material analysis. Robin
Kinross' argues that the first typographically modern typesetting
began much earlier than what is now conisdered to be the modern era
(\cite{Kinross}).

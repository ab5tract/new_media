"We flying through this forest, faster than _Return of the Jedi_"

Open notes on a night like this. Free styles from Brooklyn. Readily inked sage phrases from my own lips.

Yes. That's my style as it owns this shit.


Fighting the inertia of Thesis. An almost transbiological impulse to wait for last seconds.

A weight in working that isn't worth it, and thus chucked off.

Backwards flip, undersided unfolding upwards.

Scholars: scoff.

Wait for your prof. Your last ship sank, & now it's off.

"Think of it like Battleship."

Open interface to wood like choosing bit sizes and router coordinates.

Do I spell it out or 

turn it into your mouth shouting?


For the rest, never doubting.

Somewhere I'm left open like my lips ripping across expansive gasps for breath beyond the rest toiling at tests they can catch an arm rest this my ornery porn so its less stress just a ripped dress from passionate breaths gulping for it. a confusing matrix is love's wetness. built up to forget this/ever happened reckless/for the neckless/say my name as crystals sprout on your perfect tits/if im explicit then its for the kids/or its for the split/wet spot hooked between some coochie lips/dub-c hosts roofied hips/cuz jocks can run that shit/im out beneath the fold/till im old/the frame cant hold me/like fallujah i grew cold/do what im told?/afterwords its rolled/otherwise im cold/like before my soul grew old/omething like a toad/kiss this prince so royalty grows whats old/there its said and told/im not the one thats owed/its the frenquency that grew me/like crytalline lsd/or plates of ecstasy/just you and me/and the battles between/where is the scene?/oblivion schemes till i topple theirdreams and fold in their steam/to shake for cream.

these teets produce, don't grind me.

Constraints: Generative Design in FLoSS

"With FLOSS, the resistance of the tool is now for us such a daily meal, that it has become a work field, an investigation space, and a playground" (OSP 2010).

# Enter the Conditional #

The design world is increasingly integrating generative approaches to their workflows. The most explicit manifestation, in writing, of this impulse is the "Conditional Design Manifesto" (Maurer, Paulus, Puckey, Wouters 2008). Written by Amsterdam-based designers Luna Maurer, Edo Paulus, Jonathan Puckey, and Roel Wouters, this manifesto outlines the approach that they have named conditional design and presents its three central elements: _process_, _logic_, and _input_.




# Generative Design is driven by text #

As Lev Manovich notes, the program Processing is gaining an increasing degree of marketshare among designers---in fact, Manovich singles out Processing as "coming close to [Alan] Kay's vision" of an easy-to-use programming environment that allows users to "develop complex media programs and also to quickly test out ideas" (Manovich 2008: 79-80).

## The Piet Zwart Institute ##

Working with students from a diverse range of backgrounds, the Networked Media design program at Piet Zwart is guided by a "simple formula"--"it's not about designing _with_ media, but it's design _of_ media" (Cramer, Mansoux, and Murtaugh 2010). In their joint presentation of three of the faculty of this program at the Libre Graphics Meeting 2010 in Brussels, Florian Cramer explains that "free software provides the building blocks--the Lego bricks--for this kind of self-created media practice."[^quotes]

Not all media designed at the Piet Zwart Institute is powered by software: for example, the Open Streetlamp is nothing more than an ornamented wooden box . 

Cramer mentions the program's stance against the division of programmer and designer, citing a "classical failure of new media projects"--the lack of shared language between designer and coder leads to lackluster results. 

"We don't simply want free versions of existing tools... What we are more interested in is to see FLoSS as an entry point into a different media practice based on the comprehensive critical rethinking of communication in its relation to technology"

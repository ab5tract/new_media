Grammars of Process: Surveying the Human and the Digital Within Generative Design

Outline Instinct: Introduction

- Generative design offers interesting avenues for investigating the digital's intrinsic necessity of execution. 

- Research question: Do the existing media theories provide a suitable framework for discussing generative design? Does the physics of Simondon's transduction apply to historical and current digital process?

- The term hybridization is used to highlight the human role in shaping through the transductive forces they apply to "problem-solving."
	- Problem-solving is the driving force of advancement among digital processes. Evidence presented throughout the survey of digital typesetting demonstrates this quite clearly. Part of the trick of this, of course, is the fact that many of those problems arise completely within the domain of digital process. This is just one of the ways in which digital processes change the shape and scope, the _metapotential_, of human process. The two are so intimately intertwined at this point that the collapse of the electronic financial networks implies the collapse of economies world-wide.
	- Problem solving seems to validate the physics of Simondon's transduction, in which differences within the metastability incite transformation within the system. Transduction is the unfolding of this transformation.
	
- Grammars as channels of transduction.
	- Grammar refers to any systematization of structure.
	- Grammars enable process hybridity. Can they be seen as 'sites' of transduction?

- Douglas Crockford basically explains JavaScript by delving into deep historical discussion of the particular processes from which JavaScript was hybridized.

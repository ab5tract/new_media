# Constraints: Generative Design in FLoSS #


# Enter the Conditional #

The design world is increasingly integrating generative approaches to their workflows. The most explicit manifestation, in writing, of this impulse is the "Conditional Design Manifesto" (Maurer, Paulus, Puckey, Wouters 2008). Written by Amsterdam-based designers Luna Maurer, Edo Paulus, Jonathan Puckey, and Roel Wouters, this manifesto outlines the approach that they have named conditional design and presents its three central elements: _process_, _logic_, and _input_.


Dutch designer Pietr van Blokland, faced with the task of producing brochures in 32 different languages as the house designer of Rabobank, has "thrown away" Adobe and WYSIWYG design in favor of a generative workflow. In fact, the firms constituting the cutting edge of design in the Netherlands work within the context of generative processes (Cramer, Mansoux, and Murtaugh 2010). Florian Cramer identifies this transition to the generative as an opportunity for free software to become assert a dominant position in the field.

# Generative Design is driven by text #

As Lev Manovich notes, the program Processing is gaining an increasing degree of marketshare among designers---in fact, Manovich singles out Processing as "coming close to [Alan] Kay's vision" of an easy-to-use programming environment that allows users to "develop complex media programs and also to quickly test out ideas" (Manovich 2008: 79-80).

## The Piet Zwart Institute ##

Working with students from a diverse range of backgrounds, the Networked Media design program at Piet Zwart is guided by a "simple formula"--"it's not about designing _with_ media, but it's design _of_ media" (Cramer, Mansoux, and Murtaugh 2010). In their joint presentation of three of the faculty of this program at the Libre Graphics Meeting 2010 in Brussels, Florian Cramer explains that "free software provides the building blocks--the Lego bricks--for this kind of self-created media practice."[^quotes]

Not all media designed at the Piet Zwart Institute is powered by software: for example, the Open Streetlamp is nothing more than an ornamented wooden box . 

Cramer mentions the program's stance against the division of programmer and designer, citing a "classical failure of new media projects"--the lack of shared language between designer and coder leads to lackluster results.

Proprietary program interfaces are a product of the 1980s. The transition from "manipulation to more symbolic thinking" is a positive aspect. Mansoux notes that graphical interfaces for design can become an "annoyance" that "locks artists into constrained workflows."

"We don't simply want free versions of existing tools... What we are more interested in is to see FLoSS as an entry point into a different media practice based on the comprehensive critical rethinking of communication in its relation to technology"

They push their students to use git.


## Open Source Publishers ##

Femke Snelting and Pierre Huyghebaert are two members of Open Source Publishers, a collection of designers who collaborate on projects using only free or open source software. In a personal interview, they shared their reasons for going to open source. It was an apparent mixture of dissatisfaction with the interfaces of the proprietary offerings, which they found to be holding them back, and the ideology of free software itself (Snelting and Huyghebaert 2010).

In FLoSS, OSP finds "liberating constraints," a sensibility that finds form in a text prepared for _Libre Graphics #0!_, a magazine released at the Libre Graphics Meeting 2010: "With FLOSS, the resistance of the tool is now for us such a daily meal, that it has become a work field, an investigation space, and a playground" (OSP 2010).

Whereas the constraints of Adobe products were enough to inspire these designers to consider dropping them as tools, the constraints of open source seem to inspire OSP. Adobe products are shaped by the demands of industry, whereas FLoSS products are shaped by the demands--and self-initiative--of the community.

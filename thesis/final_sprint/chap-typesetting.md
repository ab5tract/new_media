# Crystalized Process: Text That Typesets Itself #

The time has come to for the self-reflective approach of this thesis to come into play. For a book called _Writing Space_, this work by Jay David Bolter provides scant discussion of actual writing environments on the computer. Originally written before the expansion of the World Wide Web into the sphere of popular culture, _Writing Space_ is concerns itself with "the space of electronic writing."[^second] In defining this space as "both the computer screen, where text is displayed, and the electronic memory, in which it is stored," Bolter belies the absence of process in materialist forms of media analysis (2001: 13). 

Bolter's over-simple definition of electronic writing space does not incorporate the act of writing, only the display of it. This surface-level analysis fits well the application of his remediation theory---the surface of a medium (it's "screen") is the host site of remediation. Bolter delves below the surface in his explanation of a shift to topographical writing. In the electronic writing space, "any relationships that can be defined as the interplay of pointers and elements" are representable (32). The writing space "itself has become a hierarchy of topical elements" (32). This is the effect of the computer's affinity for symbol-processing: "Any symbol in the space can refer to another symbol using its numerical address" (30). To highlight the dimensional shift in the writing space, Bolter describes the operation of outline processors. These programs abstract a text to the level of sections. These sections can be moved around and manipulated. 

[^second]: The second edition of the book, published in 2001, was used for this thesis. While it is updated to include the Web, its roots in a significantly older text are worth noting.

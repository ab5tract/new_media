\chapter{Crystalized Process: Text That Typesets Itself}

An AAA is a great organization. TeX and ConTeXt are both one-of-a-kind.

The time has come to for the self-reflective approach of this thesis to come into play. For a book called _Writing Space_, this work by Jay David Bolter provides scant discussion of actual writing environments on the computer. Originally written before the expansion of the World Wide Web into the sphere of popular culture, _Writing Space_ is concerns itself with "the space of electronic writing".[^second] In defining this space as "both the computer screen, where text is displayed, and the electronic memory, in which it is stored," Bolter belies the relative absence of process in materialist forms of media analysis (2001: 13). 

Bolter's over-simple definition of electronic writing space does not incorporate the act of writing, only the display of it. This surface-level analysis fits well the application of his remediation theory---the surface of a medium (it's "screen") is the host site of remediation. Bolter delves below the surface in his explanation of a shift to topographical writing. In the electronic writing space, "any relationships that can be defined as the interplay of pointers and elements" are representable (32). The writing space "itself has become a hierarchy of topical elements" (32). This is the effect of the computer's affinity for symbol-processing: "Any symbol in the space can refer to another symbol using its numerical address" (30). To highlight the dimensional shift in the writing space, Bolter describes the operation of outline processors. These programs abstract a text to the level of sections. These sections can be moved around and manipulated. Writing becomes _topological_ in the sense that they now have a spatial aspect. Sections of text have obtained a modularity and independence that allows visual arrangement.[^layoutproc] What he does not talk about is the formats generated by the Macintosh program that he uses in his figures. He mentions passing layouts around on floppies between friends, but that assumes a parity of operating systems and proprietary software (at least in his example) (!CITE!).

[^layoutproc]Almost twenty years later, layout processors have been for the most part subsumed by word processors. The layout shifting process has been hybridized into the increasingly feature-ful assemblages of word processors where it has not morphed into a niche proprietary product.

# Environment of Operation #

This text is not typed in the manner that you see it. The above header is instead written like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  # Environment of Operation #
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Through the wrapper program `pandoc`, this input (written in Markdown) is converted into HTML and ConTeXt outputs.

HTML
:	`<h1>Environment of Operation</h1>`

ConTeXt
:	`\section{Environment of Operation}`

The syntax of HTML represents a semantic operation: "Dear Mr. Browser, treat this as a header of level 1." The syntax of ConTeXt, however, represents a macro command within a programming language. What it says is "call the sections of code that translate the text within the brackets to the parameters specified for the `\section{}` command."

The literal 'writing space' of this thesis is a program called Textroom. Textroom is a minimalist text editor in which there are no buttons, taskbars, or other clutter. Only you, your words, and (optionally) informational text reporting the time, word count, percentage to accomplishing your writing goal, etc. By writing in plain-text, I open myself to the opportunities afforded me by version control systems. Developed to enable collaboration of programmers on a code base, version control systems can track changes in text across time (useful for this project) and allow for massively distributed workflows involved tens of thousands of individuals (useful for the Linux kernel).

## Constraints ##

Above you see a necessary adaptation within my workflow. My netbook took a fall and lost the ability to use its screen. Because of the nature of the command line, I was able to log in to computer and execute commands that allowed me to establish remote access using a piece of software called `ssh`. This remote connection can also support the transmission of GUI applications using the client-server model at the heart of the X Windows system (which drives the GNU/Linux GUI). This was important a) to get files off the netbook, and b) the version of `pandoc` on my desktop had stopped working after a modular dependency was upgraded and I was finding it impossible to upgrade `pandoc` itself. In the image above we see the minimal editor Textroom and the editor gvim. Because of the pandoc incompatibility on the desktop, I was forced to use the netbook as the site of typesetting. This shaped the output of the project most likely by time. However, the simple ability to log in and enable remote access shaped this project immensely by allowing me to extract important work that would otherwise have been lost.

An unfortunate constraint is the inability to take advantage of elements of the TeX landscape that are reknowned for making life easier. The chief among these is BibTeX, which allows for a bibliography to be dynamically generated and citations to be inserted according to a variety of formats (that one can change with a single line of text, if desired). By abstracting myself from TeX by using Markdown as the "pre-format," I've lost the opportunity to easily manage bibliographic data and instead must input it by hand. That said, the MLA format is not currently available in BibTeX meaning that--even if I could use this software--the output would be necessarily shaped by the constraints of the tools.

## A pre-format necessarily complicates while it simplifies ##

Using the 'markdown' pre-format complicates several issues with typesetting documents in both HTML and ConTeXt. For instance, ConTeXt includes a `\chapter{}` macro, which influences the numbering of sections so that sections are relative to the chapter number, rather than to the entire text. Thus the first section of chapter two will be rendered into text as '2.1'. The issue arises because HTML has no similar distinction: sections are related to the depth of the header, such that H1 is the highest level section (the equivalent of ConTeXt's `\chapter{}`). In markdown, the top-level section appears as
in the example above, that is using a single '#'. My initial solution was to include two sections with only one '#' per chapter, the first of which I would manually change from `\section{}` to `\chapter{}`, with the result that the sectioning of the chapter fits what is expected---chapter 2, section 1 is numbered as '2.1'.

This does not satisfy HTML, however, as there is nothing to change the first single '#' into: it is already inserting the highest level section, 'H1'. Thus, where ConTeXt begins numbering the sections within the chapter (2.1, 2.2, etc.), HTML increments the top-level section number, so that the second single '#' increments to '3', instead of to '2.1'. If a double '##' is used, the sectioning will appear as we desire in the HTML, but will appear as '2.0.1' in ConTeXt. This incompatibility requires either modifying the Pandoc source code directly or else the creation of a specific 'helper' script to create a sectioning parity between the two output formats. As I do not know Haskell, I've opted for the second solution.

Since markdown allows passing TeX commands, I solved the problem by using `\chapter{}` to designate the chapter title. Then, using a command-line script written in the Ruby programming language, a copy of the markdown file is created in which `\chapter{}` is replaced by a single '#' and all subsequent '#'s are increased by one '#' until the next `\chapter{}` is reached. From this copy we generate the HTML version, while the original can be processed into TeX.

Perhaps this technical description appears to be more of a computer science discussion than it is a media theory one. However it highlights the ways in which processes hybridize: the conflicting grammars of ConTeXt and HTML create a complication which the wrapper program Pandoc either does not or can not address. To work around this issue, a separate program (the Ruby interpeter) is used to integrate a script file which deals with the problem. This is a common feature of a command-line based workflow: "glue" scripts are written in order to fuse processes together. This glue can result from 

### Regular Expressions and Process Hybridity ###

Regular expressions represent another avenue for demonstrating process hybridity. Since their introduction into the early text editors `QED` and `ed` by Ken Thompson, regular expressions have since been incorporated into many Unix commands such as `grep` and `awk`, newer editors such as `vi` and `emacs`, and programming languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and many more (_Regular expression_ 2010). Regular expressions are a means for describing parameters of text searches, whereby arranging esoteric control characters in and around the text one is looking to find allows for finely tuned pattern matching. 

The hybridity of regular expressions lies in it's adoption by nearly every major programming language: from Wikipedia, the list includes "Java, JavaScript, PCRE, Python, Ruby, Microsoft's .Net Framework, and the W3C's XML Schema" (_Regular expression_ 2010). This list of languages refers to those who have hybridized some form or derivative of Perl's implementation of regular expressions, which is considered more robust than Ken Thompson's original version.

Is it possible to say that these programming languages are 'remediating' the regular expressions from Perl? It is not beyond reason to assert that programming languages are 'mediums'---Ken Thompson has referred to Smalltalk as a new medium, for instance (!CITE!). However, mapping the term medium onto a programming language falls into the same trap of stretching the term medium until it becomes incomprehensible. Do different versions of the same language, representing different capabilities and even incompatible syntax changes, constitute separate mediums? What is useful about applying the term medium here, other than it enables us to discuss the prolific implementation of regular expressions as an example of 'remediation'? 

Programming languages often borrow concepts from each other, as this example of regular expressions clearly demonstrates. Saying that Perl remediates C syntax because it uses curly braces and semi-colons under-emphasizes Perl's own syntax. Rather it seems more evocative to describe ways in which Perl hybridizes elements of C's grammar while augmenting them with grammar of its own.

In other words, to say that 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
my $variable = "value";    # defining a variable in Perl 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
is a remediation of
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
char[5] variable = "value"; /* defining a variable in C */
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
is an over-simplification. It obfuscates significant algorithmic differences in the two approaches by focusing on the surface level syntax (which is relatively similar) over the significant internal differences in the way the two languages deal with variables (such as static versus dynamic typing). The grammar of C is hybridized by Perl---re-implemented rather than remediated, related yet irreconcilable. Implementation differences have huge implications on the utility and functionality of the languages, a theoretical framework that focuses on surface-level similarities is incapable of expressing the variation that occurs beneath those similarities. 

Rather than a remediation of regular expressions, then, we see a hybridization of specific grammars of regular expressions, with the most popularly hybridized grammar deriving from the version found in Perl. However, many of the languages that hybridize the Perl version of regular expressions only implement a particular subset of that version. Additionally, extensions may be added that are not included in Perl. The result is a proliferation of regex--in the programmer shorthand for 'regular expression'--grammars as they are integrated into various process hybridities such as programming languages, command line utilities, and text editors.

The website _Rubular_ stands as an example of how far-reaching the hybridization of regular expressions has come in terms of process assemblage complexity (Lovitt 2010). The website utilizes not only the HTTP protocol that drives the World Wide Web, it uses AJAX in order to provide real-time representations of pattern matching within a Ruby interpreter (of which there are many). The GUI browser is involved in this assemblage by design[^zen]. So is a web framework of some kind, from the looks of it the increasingly ubiquitous Ruby on Rails There could be an argument made against such far-reaching hybridity: Ruby can be programmed in interactively, line by line, in it's interpreter. The layers of code wrapped around the processing of Ruby regexes

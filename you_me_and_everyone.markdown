## Revisions of a digital culture #

Digital natives versus digital revolutionaries. The driving forces of the digital revolution remain in play, and even intensify, "but there is nothing left to rebel against."

The Internet is not a force for good or evil: it's a phenomenon.

2 Modes of Being for the Teens

- Gothic High Tech 
- Favala(sp?) chic

Goth High Tech is the past, the dead areas that were formerly thriving but no cannot be made to work (digitally paved over, remediated, etc). The necessary consequence of the transition to digital. "Shrink-wrapped ruins."


Favala chic, "like using a Mac laptop to hammer in a nail." User-centric, rather than planned. Always in beta. Papers over its failings with utopian trappings. 'Electronic democracy' is spam, astroturf, partisan blogs. 'Digital artisanship' means job instability. 

Flaws
- "Can't take yes for an answer,"
- Cannot handle criticism of itself

"Massive jargon imperialists." 

Lots of very advanced hardware thats going obsolete quickly.

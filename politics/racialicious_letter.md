Dear Racialicious,

Firstly I need to show my appreciation for your site. While my departure from the US and my subsequent enrollment in a masters program in new media have slowed my blog reading habits considerably, any time I find myself checkng your page I find myself with new understandings (and, of course, new questions).

One such time was the day Latoya posted her summary of the Reggie Bush/_Essence_ cover controversy. While my own background leaves me far from the experience of a black female in America, I was struck by this case. My own distaste for the mainstream media notwithstanding, it blew me away in its articulation of the reductive nature of the industrial news machine. The prevailing logic of the blogosphere is that it serves to break stories---that is, to breach the planned news cycles with uncomfortable facts. Yet here is a case where the _absence_ of the story in the mainstream was appreciated by Latoya in her piece and many commenters here in the post's thread. The community concerned was allowed space to digest the highly varying responses to the cover choice, a space that would apparently not be available had the mainstream began to feed the story through its commodifying mechanisms.

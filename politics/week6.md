David J. Gunkel centers his 'Second thoughts: toward a critique of the digital divide' on the ambiguous, yet ubiquitous, nature of the term 'digital divide.' In the terms of Latour, he sees the term as a matter of contention. His reaction is to push for a broadened understanding of the plural nature of the term. Tracing the origins of 'digital divide' through the claims made by one of its main promoters (the US Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA) as to where they found it, they come across journalism discussing a division between those who held faith in technology to solve the world's problems and those that had misgivings about having such faith. Even at this early stage there is a binary modulation on a much more complicated scenario--for instance, those that have faith in technology to have the _potential_ to solve problems might not have deep reservations about answering in affirmative if that potential was phrased in technodetermistic terms in a survey question. As the term continues its unfolding into its present state as a household term, it retains these binary and technodetermistic attributes and gains a plurality of definitions. From hardware clashes between digital and analog devices coexisting in information networks to being situated as analagous to a 'racial ravine' where statistics show correlations to race in terms of access to devices and knowledge, the digital divide is multifaceted. In Gunkel's view, in order to continue using the term it should be interrogated for what it has claimed to cover, basing this on the recognition that the phenomenons it has been used to describe all fit under the discussions it has been used to describe. The answer lies in developing a self-reflexivity by questioning "the terms and conditions by which studies of the digital divide define their own mode of questioning" (Gunkel 2003: 517).

Yet simply recognizing the gradation of potential instances of the digital divide does not arbitrate its reliance on a binary structure. Gunkel does not problematize binary thinking, though I find his justification of its necessity to be problematic because he magically equates "Western thought" with "meaningful discourse" (508). Yet the point remains: "In defining others as deficient, one does not simply provide a neutral expression of inequality" (508). By separating what is actually a diversity of levels and modes of connectivity into a dualistic division, the term digital divide misframes its subject.[^1] Perhaps his division of equating 'binary' to 'coherent' and therefore its opposite with 'incoherence' is a knowing example of his suggestion to utilize binary logic to interrogate the limits of the binary division _not_ represented but _implanted_ by the term digital divide.

The third outstanding issue, then, is the continued reliance of the digital divide on technodeterminism. In fact, its invocation bears the weight of accepting by fiat that access to technology automatically yield social, economic, and, presumably even if never evoked, spiritual benefits. Gunkel quickly notes that history does not bear out such an interpretation, nor do statistical surveys of usage patterns on the internet. The telegraph "did not hasten the coming of the kingdom of heaven but supported nationalist aggression and empire-building" (515). Which is true, though I bristled that Enzensberger was listed as a member of those who had faith in the capacity of radio without qualifying his own intense critique of technodeterminism. The potential of radio was never tested to its natural social limits, as the internet to some extent has been. This is, after all, what usage statistics measure. Governments did not trust their citizens with access to a many-to-many communications mechanism and the throbbing logic of capitalism provided the perfect excuse to hand over the reigns to corporations and mandate a mandatory crippling of all radio devices. Given the progress of the corporatization of the internet in tandem with a continued push for copyright control to extend to hardware, Enzensberger's critique remains as valid as ever. Indeed, a 'digital divide' between access to programmable versus non-programmable devices might one day emerge. Gunkel's response to the technodeterministic overtones of the digital divide is similar to his call for self-reflexivity: he calls for questioning "the terms and conditions by which studies of the digital divide define their own mode of questioning." (517)

[^1]: For Gunkel, the binary mode of thinking is not itself a problem, but it seems a remaining issue to me.

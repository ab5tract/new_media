- "Gurl please their male overseers wouldn’t let them put Robin Thicke on the cover.  Stop playing. No Robin Thicke on the cover would be a provocative act on their part, but they don’t do provocative, only sensationalism.."

- "Well anywhoo, _this is clearly a cry for attention from ESSENCE_.. Because while ESSENCE readers might look beyond things like older men having sex with underage girls, infidelity,  or being advised to go compete with STRIPPERS for a Black man’s attention and any host of other foolishness ESSENCE has thrown at us, _apparently if you want to have a REVOLT, bring up dating a non-Black woman on an issue that supposed to be about LOVE & RELATIONSIHPS with BLACK WOMEN._" (emph. added)

- "The overwhelming reaction has been vicious and scornful. It appears for now that the vast majority of you are offended, at worst, and not thrilled, at best, over the site of Bush's chiseled chocolate chesticles and cheese-grate worthy abs peering out from your local newsstand."
	
- "We got issues, ya’ll. Note the we. I‘m not sitting on high horse judging anybody for their unresolved ish when I got my own fair share. It just so happens though that my ish?  Well, it ain’t with Black men dating non-Black women or a overtly troubled self-worth from being born brown in a world that lauds White."
	
- "Reggie Bush, or any successful and/or attractive Black man didn’t do anything to us, in general, or to you, in particular. So why are we flipping out on him like he did?"
	- this after a quote from comedian Katt Williams (qualified with "he might be crazy, but when he’s lucid, he drops bombs") places the responsibility for self-esteem solely on an individual, echoing the redistribution of the responsibility for discrimination onto the discriminated (Chun)
	
- "Reggie Bush, or any successful and/or attractive Black man didn’t do anything to us, in general, or to you, in particular. So why are we flipping out on him like he did? This self-loathing, woe-is-me stance that’s being evoked all across the Internet over this cover is something we did to ourselves. We tied up our self-worth in someone else’s perception — a recipe for disaster if ever there was one— and now we feel like crap because we don’t think the Black men we aspire to have see us the way we see ourselves."
	
- "I think the man is a god among men and partially that's because I can place whatever personality/fantasy I chose on him because he never opens his mouth to say something like, “Malcolm X? What does the X stand for?” I don’t even know what his voice sounds like (but it my mind it’s very bass-y and commanding.)"
	
- "And too, stop fronting like you ain’t never done no wild ish with your man. (Lewis Williams over at ihustlenation.com didn’t write that blog about “doing the most” for nothing.) The only reason your tapes, sexts, emails, voice-mails and tales of your wild ish aren’t everywhere is because you’re not even C-list famous."
	- dropping a little snarky superiority?
	
- "I don’t have a sex tape, and for the love of God I don’t understand why people keep making them since it seems like they keep leaking, but I’m not coming down hard on a woman who did some wild ish with her man. Of three years. There are some folks reading who’ve done crazier acts (perhaps off camera) with men they just met."
	
- "To hurl unfounded names and judgments at her just for pulling a Black athlete that you’d probably otherwise want to do if he weren’t with her (more on that in a moment), says more about the name-caller than it does the woman being called names. We’re making things about her that have nothing to do with her. Let me make it plain: Kim Kardashian has nothing to do with a society that lets non-Black women get away with behavior that we can’t. Stop unloading your ish on her."
	
- "My fantasies involve me, and the man I’m fantasizing about. I can’t believe how many of ya’ll are looking at Reggie Bush’s glare that threatens to "beat the @#$$%" up like a Ying Yang chorus and those wide shoulders holding the promise of flipping a chick like she’s just one more on a stack at the international house of pancakes and still thinking about his woman."
	
- "Might I suggest you change the batteries on your device so you can stay focused on more important matters like getting off. Either that or try working thru your issues so you can enjoy the splendor of a fine man, as you were meant to, without all that other mess getting in the way."

*Essence Takes Heat For Reggie Bush Cover* [http://blogs.bet.com/entertainment/spotlight/2010/01/07/essence-takes-heat-for-reggie-bush-cover/](http://blogs.bet.com/entertainment/spotlight/2010/01/07/essence-takes-heat-for-reggie-bush-cover/)

- short piece that does exactly what Racialicious expects the traditional media to do: reduce the issue to black women rejecting it because Bush dates a white woman
	
- "The February issue featured 10 black men, including Idris Elba, LL Cool J and Lance Gross in the cover story so they could’ve easily picked another one of those men as the first image you see on their Black love issue, but is it really that big of a deal or are people just making an issue out of nothing? What do you think?"

- again the issue is reduced to binaries
	
- "Bush has been in a high-profile relationship with reputed HOcialite Kim Kardashian since 2007 — and that’s the main source of consternation for those protesting the Essence’s February cover. Some can’t help but wonder why editors chose to put a Black Man who is rumored to shun Black women as potential mates on the cover of mag that targets them. Thoughts?"

- "Daaaamn, girl, sistas is MAD HEATED at the editors of Essense for putting Reggie Bush on the cover of their “Black Men, Love & Relationships” issue. You see, Reggie Bush isn’t dating a black girl. He’s dating Kim Kardashian, who, for some reason, Essence readers think is white.
	Kim Kardashian is not white. She’s middle eastern, and clearly a woman “of color.” She’s not black, but she’s not Amy Adams. Are these girls blind, or do they think KK got her skin shade from sleeping outside during the day?
	Listen to these _shrieking banshees:_" (hyperlink italicized, to the same missing page at essence.com)

- "Reggie Bush is on the latest cover of Essence magazine. The question is how do sistas feel about Reggie flaunting Kim Kardashians goodies all over a magazine geared toward black women, 42% of whom are single and can't find a good man. How do the female DW readers feel about this?"

*Reggie Bush Covers Essence Mag, Black Women Are Mad* [http://hellobeautiful.com/your-world/jeanene-james/reggie-bush-covers-essence-mag-black-women-are-pd/](http://hellobeautiful.com/your-world/jeanene-james/reggie-bush-covers-essence-mag-black-women-are-pd/)

- "There is some valid argument in this perspective, though it is mostly exclusionary in nature and therefore flawed." (the perspective mentioned is essence caters to black women, reggie dates non-black women, essence doesnt care about black women)
	
- "But why are black women really upset? Is it the fact that Bush chose a white girlfriend? At what point does his personal preference in women cross over into territory that is really none of our business? And while it is understandable that his choice in a partner is irrelevant so long as it is not broadcast on an avenue designated for black women, does this discount the fact that he is still a black man? Must we exclude the opinions of black men that don’t date black women? On some level, this seems unfair. Reggie Bush represents one clear perspective; although it is not approved of by everyone, why should his perspective be excluded from discussion in a black women’s magazine?"
	
- "Rather than coming down on those who made the decision, however, it seems much more prudent for black women who are angry, or disapproving of Bush’s relationship choices to use this opportunity to voice their opinions and engage in conversation about the touchy subject."
	- interesting, because this seems to be exactly what has happened
	
- "Essence is not calling Reggie Bush the authority on black love. It is simply honoring an attractive black man, and seeking his individual perspective."
	- but other blog posts state that he is not asked about multiracial relationships

- "If Essence editors weren’t aware before, they know now that the average, black, female demographic is fairly intelligent and not at all as gullible as Essence thinks they are."
	
- "Not only is the pic old (Essence can’t afford photo shoots at the moment) — but readers objected to the fact that Reggie could care less about dating black women. So why put him on the cover of a magazine that targets a majority black female demographic?"
	
*Reggie Bush: Essence Cover Boy* [http://brownsista.com/reggie-bush-essence-cover-boy/](http://brownsista.com/reggie-bush-essence-cover-boy/)

- "The Essence boards are reeling over the fact Kim Kardashian’s boy toy Reggie Bush is being featured on the cover. The major consensus is that a man who is dating outside of his race should not be on the cover of a magazine aimed towards Black women. What are your thoughts on this?"


*Shirtless Reggie Bush Covers Essence* [http://backseatcuddler.com/2010/01/09/shirtless-reggie-bush-covers-essence/](http://backseatcuddler.com/2010/01/09/shirtless-reggie-bush-covers-essence/)

- "Essence  is taking all kinds of crap for putting New Orleans Saint Reggie Bush on their February 2010 cover.   Many readers are unhappy that a black women’s interest magazine would feature a man who dates outside the race for the cover of the  “Black Men, Love and Relationships” issue.   Check out the arguments here to see just how some sisters feel about Reggie, not to mention his on-again, off-again girl Kim Kardashian. Or, if you are so inclined, you can just enjoy Reggie’s six-pack."

- "Should ESSENCE have put Reggie Bush on the cover of its Love Issue?"

*Is America Really Post-racial? A Definition and Assessment of Post-racialism in the US* [http://racism-politics.suite101.com/article.cfm/postracialism_in_america](http://racism-politics.suite101.com/article.cfm/postracialism_in_america)

- first return on a search for 'definition post-racial' at google.com

- "A true definition is undoubtedly hard to come by, as the term and connotations of the term are dubious. The idea of a post-racial society, in its most basic form, is a society in which race is no longer significant or important."

- "Ironically, the media, which is the institution claiming post-racialism, is the very institution promoting a racial divide. When analyzing the votes, the press looks at the racial demographic break down of the votes and highlights it on the front page of major newspapers. If we are to truly think we're beyond the focus of race, it shouldn't be the main focus."

- Adrienne focuses on the fact that David Duke doesn't hate Obama as a sign of "coming a long way"

- comments clearly demonstrate the "white people are beyond race, black people are racist" trope

*What is post-racial America? [View from the Right]* [http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/010000.html](http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/010000.html)

- "Presumably a post-racial, beyond-race America will be one in which no one thinks about race any more, an America in which we all just see each other as individuals. This is most puzzling, since I was not aware that Obama has called for the elimination of the vast system of race-conscious preferences for blacks and other nonwhite groups that is institutionalized at every level of our society."

- "If post-racial America does not mean the removal of these pro-nonwhite, anti-white policies and beliefs, what does it mean? It means a post-white America, an America transformed by the symbolic removal of whiteness as the country's explicit or implicit historic and majority identity."

- "The post-racial America of which Obama's champions speak does not mean the end of racial preferences for nonwhites. It does not mean the end of constant accusations of white racism. It does not mean the end of the systematic cover-up of blacks' lower abilities, and of the fact that these lower abilities, not white racism, are the reason blacks are behind. It does not mean the end of the systematic cover up of the true facts of black-on-white crime. It does not mean the end of mandatory sensitivity training for whites. It does not mean the end of the belief that there is a moral cloud over America's entire history up until the civil rights movement--or, in the event Obama is elected, up until the election of Barack Obama."

- "Post-racial America is an America in which whites, as whites, go silent forever."

	- Sage McLaughlin: ""Post-racial America" can only mean an America in which white racial consciousness can be said to be definitively dead; it surely does not mean that nonwhite racial consciousness and nonwhite racial spoils will be considered dead. ... Moving beyond racial divisions simply means ceasing any resistance to the full scope of blacks' and nonwhite foreigners' demands on white America."

	- Tim W.: "I agree with much of your take on this, but is it not possible that an Obama administration would wake a portion of white America up? ... Assuming we don't elect Obama, I don't see any of the anti-white policies you describe changing. ... I've said before that I think we're in really bad shape as a nation, and our population is largely brainwashed by political correctness. Maybe, just maybe, the shock of a black president, with a shrill race-obsessed wife, would prompt the frog to jump out of the pot before it reaches boiling temperature."

	- Mark Jaws: "First of all, based on the symptoms you have described, I would say that we have been in "post-racial America" for over 30 years. To approximately 99 percent of whites, it is forbidden for them to think as whites and to act from the white perspective. ... I believe once affluence begins to fade in this post-racial world and crime, disease, poverty begin to consume whole states, we will see whites acting more like men, and less as mice."

	- LA (in a continuing discussion of whether 'post-racial' America has arrived): "It is prohibited in the American mainstream to discuss any issue, such as immigration or minority race preferences, in terms of race or white racial concerns. Not just prohibited, but white people don't want to do it, don't believe in it, and recoil from the very idea of it. ... In a post-racial America, white people would lose the moral confidence to argue even in non-racial terms against open borders, because they would have accepted the idea that this was racist and intolerant and divisive."

	- Paul Gottfried: "Certainly you can't blame the blacks for this anti-white discrimination, since it is white Americans who choose to do these things to themselves. You have certainly seen the news in US News and World Report about which historical figures young American adults admire most. These heroines were all black leftists, and the only male who made it on to the list is MLK. People who think this way deserve not Obama's set aside policies but the pleasures of living under Robert Mugabe."

*What is “Post-Racial” and Where Is It?* [http://www.jackandjillpolitics.com/2009/03/what-is-post-racial-and-where-is-it/](http://www.jackandjillpolitics.com/2009/03/what-is-post-racial-and-where-is-it/)

- "First of all, I’m not sure I want to be “post-racial” because that would mean denial of one’s ethnic, racial and cultural heritage, and I’m not down with that, especially if that’s what it means to be “post-racial” in America."

- second point is the increase in racially motivated events since the election of Obama

- "What does “Post-Racial” mean to YOU?  And should America be striving for that, rather than continue working towards facilitating diversity and inclusion, while respecting and accepting that citizens of this country come from all walks of life, from every culture and religious practice; from every creed and ethnicity?  What would a “Post-Racial” America look like?"
	- asking for feedback in a clearly multi-valent manner

	- _ASmith_: "It's a feel good term for white folks so they can stop saying "I'm not racist, I have black friends" Don't get me wrong, I understand that a lot of white folks feel guilty and they don't know why when they've never called a black person a n*gger (i'm a very tongue-in-cheek person, so this may go over people's heads) so they need this post-racial stuff, but the ONLY thing we need to be focused on is being honest and calling our society post-racial is not being honest and only continuing what has been wrong all this time."

	- eclecticbrotha: "I have noticed something interesting happening whenever you bring up issues of race since Obama's election that I would like to coin "pulling the POST-racial card:" Blacks and whites alike claiming that issues of race are no longer relevant topics of discussion because electing the black guy with the funny name proves America isn't a racially divided society anymore. Its absolute BS, of course. What we have is a "get out of white gulit free" card being thrown in our faces whenever we try to confront the issues that remain relevant to our people. We can't let this crap walk."

	- RobM: "This is beyond silly. There is no such thing as post racial. Even as a construct it doesn't work because it means there is one race."

	- isonprize: ""Post racial" is a cowardly term that folks, mostly white folks, are trying to use to excuse the uncomfortable feeling they get when issues of race arise. That feeling usually manifests itself in the phrase "Can't we just get past all that and not talk about it anymore?" That is how I interpret the term 'post-racial' "

	- Acts of Faith Blog: "Hmmm that's like asking if it's a sexism free world - DUMB QUESTION/IDIOT ASSUMPTION."

	- GreenLadyHere: "POST-RACIAL has NOT ARRIVED. BUT - - I do believe, as the article stated, a STEP has been made! Annnnnd, MSM - - the 'originators" of the TERM OUGHT TA STEP UP and do THEIR PART in CREATIN' something that THEY POSED!!"

	- spirit_55z: "As for "Post-Racial" I 'm not buying into another label. No sir ree, I aint doing it! It's just another term to hide behind and not deal with unaccepable behavior. And in this case, RACIST, hurtful, and damaging behaviors. The MSM, newspapers, blogsand folks will continue to get called on their RACIST behavior. We will hold their asses accountable."
		- CPL: "Whycome "they" gotta keep labeling us, Spirit?"
			- spirit_55z: "If we were in a so called post racial society, we wouldn't need to be talking about why it isn't a post-racial society ... No Black faces in MSM tv news as anchors, or late night talk shows. All lilly white faces. Which means whites drive the narrative for POC. ... POST- RACIAL implies, Go shut the fuck up and sit down now, you've got a black president., so we don't have to deal with our sorry ass, damaging, history of centuries of institutional RACISM."
	
	- JunePearl: "What people are saying when they say "post-racial” is: I don't have to do anything else towards the cause of equality. ... _In a post-racial society our social problem is no longer, issues are now my personal problem._[^1] ... Just as "nigger" carries with it the history of overt racism, "post-racial" carries with it the connotations and realities of covert racism. ... "

*The Watchman: We are not yet a post-racial society* [http://thepoliticalwatchman.blogspot.com/2009/01/we-are-not-yet-post-racial-society.html](http://thepoliticalwatchman.blogspot.com/2009/01/we-are-not-yet-post-racial-society.html)

- "The following statement may shock some people who have long strived for a colorblind society as a solution to the racism that has plagued us: a colorblind society is detrimental, no matter how well-intentioned, to the cause of creating a post-racial society."

- "Colorblindness is, by definition, a position of ignorance.  It chooses to ignore and deny the reality around us, opting for a collective mental enema that makes social thought-criminals out of anyone intrepid enough to acknowledge or discuss race.  It looks upon the rainbow that is our country and see a dull, gray arc.  A post-racial society cannot be one bred in defiance of the truth but one bred in reason and intellectualism - one that can intelligently use the lessons of the past and thusly  strive toward a better, more cohesive future."

- "Order at the expense of knowledge is a tyranny of the ignorant.  We must reject this existence for ourselves."

- "Rather than colorblindness, let us strive for a respectful color-conscious society that chooses to see and know our differences - that fearlessly confronts the most uncomfortable qualities from the underbelly of our nation."

- "Appropriately enough, it is the election of an African American man as President that has triggered a feeling of final accomplishment in the social war on racism."

Introduction
	- art is an important part of the course
	- "New Media: always and forever 'new'"
  - computers became a medium after the GUI/multimedia/internet
	- "End of..."
		- ...grand narratives: Marxism could be the last one; no more sense of eventual redemption at the end of the tunnel
		- ...history: neoliberalism/capitalism conquors the world
		- ...ideology: 'end of socialism meant the end of idealistic politics'; satisfaction is to be found in pragmatic acceptanc of capitalism
		- ...theory: 'computers would bring the end of theorizing/hypothesizing' due to the quantitative capacity of the computer
		- ...memory: we are no longer consciously aware of the fact that the "new" is really a repetition of an ongoing cycle
			- the twitter revolution (of Iran) has a history in SMS (Phillipines) and the net (WTO '99)
	- "Free"
		- demonitization
		- Nigel Ferguson: "As long as money has been in society, there have been detractors. The dream of a 'free economy' has been around since the beginning."
		- Gift economies are very old; revitalized by P2P and F/OSS
		- cyberspace inspired idealized utopian visions; pure collaboration
	- "With enough data, the numbers speak for themselves" - Chris Anderson [preceding: "Who knows why people do what they do? The point is they do it, and we can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity."]
		- 'correlation is not the same as causation' - theory cannot be totally removed by statistics 
	- Number crunching & pattern recognition
		- Lorenz: using [practically] the same data with the same algorithm led to wildly different outcomes
	- Engelbart - "augmentation of intellect" ties into 'reality as a "social construction"'
	- "technology as means for emancipation" vs "technology as dehumanizing"

	Convergences
		- associaive trails vs floating signifiers
			- computers should take into account the human way of thinking (Bush)
			- words don't have fixed meanings but change over contexts; meaning never really settles down
		- probabilities and correlations vs "writerly texts"
			- static laws are quite rare;
			- text that accomplishes a co-creation between a reader and author
		- multi-modality vs synesthesia/multisensory
			- visualization of scientific data for rhetorical impact / conveyence of information; more believable to see than to read

	Beyond Utopianism
		- "how to study new media with new media"
		- cultural analytics
			- how to deal with all the data; making sense from the noise
		- software studies
			- what are the effects; cultural impacts; 
		- network studies
			- develop ways to analyze the internet with the internet
		- coming full circle, as these were the very first questions asked; beginning of a new cycle

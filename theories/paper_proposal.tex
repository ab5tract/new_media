There is an extensive amount of theory surrounding peer-to-peer technologies. This paper will attempt a thorough review of the available literature in order to investigate avenues of resistance through varying degrees of 'nonexistence' (Galloway and Thacker), 'paranodism' (Mejias), and 'not working' (Lovink). 

How can such modes be operationalized, rather than simply theorized? The work done so far is so theoretical as to be unintelligible. How can one participate in a network without becoming a node? How do we "focus on the edges" while striving for "nonexistence" as Galloway and Thacker propose?

Benjamin _does_ say that art should have no higher purpose.

The last paragraph reads like a rejection of technological determinism. However, Enzensberger is not a technological determinist. New media is not being extensively used in the way that Enzensberger advocated. And anyway, he only said that "only a collective, organized effort can tear down these paper walls." (p.267) To the extent that actors have "aggressively" organized, they have been quite successful in "tearing down paper walls." To say that the WTO protests did nothing to reveal a 'hidden" side of capitalism and globalization for those who observed the event is nonsensical.

"Social shaping"

Google as beta means producer and consumer divide is fading? Seems like an untenable position. Is Google Docs a means of production? Are we producers when we use this means, even if we do not "own" the means of production? Does their statistical data mining allow a user to be anything other than a consumer? 

The People versus the multitude. Is the multitude the "final stage" of Enzensberger's advocacy for conscious, collective expression?

Is OLPC really a refutation of Winner?

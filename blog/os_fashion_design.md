Recruit an initial team to design and build a suite of open source software to
- create, import, and mofigy clothing patterns
- match variations in body size

The goal of the software is to lower the barrier to entry for independent garment designers.

Designs created with open software are owned by the designer. No royalties are paid.

Women's ready-to-wear sizes are based on 2 inch increments of bust size. Yet bust sze is unrealted to any other measurement of the body, so much of ready-to-wear clothing does not fit well.

By creating design software based on body relatinoships, we can offer sewists an improved proess of desgning garments that fit.

Increased regional identity/personal identity.

Global sewing machines sales are higher now than at any other times ince the 1950's. Many sewers are new to sewing but are looking for pattern softare to help them express their personal style.

Schools and educational environments would have access to fashion design software without purchasing multiple lcenses.

Cross-pollination of young fashion designers who are introduced to the open source community through the FLOSS fashion software.

Future projects/expanded functionality
- 3D scanner integration
- cutting table integratin
- layout and yardage optimization
- seam information embedded in pattern
- shematics included for wearable electronics

Current options
- are proprietary
- don't interoperate
- may require additional backends (CAD/Photoshop)

# The Art of Tiling, Modularizing, and De-Commodifying #

Since the advent of the Macintosh, a specific regime of GUI (Graphical User Interface) semantics have totalized the popular interfaces of PCs (which, yes, Apple products fall into typologically).[^1] The most mainstream defier of this system (dominated by desktops, mice, and application-derived window positioning) is GNU/Linux, where every possible option is open because the source is free. This post discusses the emerging dominance of tiling window managers amongst the hacker types, emerging forms of OSS-driven design, and alternative operating systems that deliver unique GUI adaptations to the global source tree. We will even discuss the ways in which the proprietary software space is mutating in response.

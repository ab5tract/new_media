# Introductory speakers #

1. What are the possibilities and pitfalls in interactivity, art, and public space?

2. How to contribute to civility in these precarious times?

# Affect #

## Kluitenberg ##

- video of Ligna, a radio-controlled collective street performance; flash mob
	- "I Am(not)sterdam"

- overburdening of the senses
	- exemplary artist Raphael Barzamo Hammer
		- "In relation to the 'violence of the visual' that is taking over the public space: we don't want less images, we want *more* images"

- informational environment versus cognition

- The Third Body
	- emotional attachment to records; first time playing a record, a certain experience happens; when the record is put away, the experience is not fully present, just a memory; but when the record is listened again, the experience returns
	- the experience is not attached to the listeners body, nor the record, but this "third" body
	- the third body is not technologically determined
	- digital technologies are technologies of complete andperfect articulation (especially in regards to control sequences, etc)
	- something needs to be left out for digitization; what is missing is the precise thing that makes us feel that the digital object is anemic; 

- affect is the thing discarded by digitization

- we need art that points beyond itself in a negative way
	- the denial of the system's rules, of its inherent methodologies
	- the word processor (elle
	- the bubblespace: intervention and rupture where the intervention itself points beyond the technology
	- take scenarios where interactivity is truly and literally forced

	- "break the frame" as well as "impose the frame"

## Round Table 1 ##

- interpassive systems such as speed bumps: if the speed bumps are there as a result of lobbying from the concrete industry and not as a result of democracy, is it still interpassivity? and the tension between the cognitive and the body's desire for cigarettes? why should we listen to the cognitive over the body?
	- (Gijs): interactive and interpassive eras are not defined by a clean split: "tectonic plates" shifting together
	
# Interface #

## Lovink ##

- Is the interace luring us away from the hidden powers of the new media or is it the real battlefield?

- If we want to reach more audiences, one possible solution could be that we look more at the interface level. Should we put more money into new media arts programs and computer science? Or should we raise issues of aesthetics and politics of interfaces to highlight the underlying power of the systems?

## Galloway ##

- Powerful example of the interface in society today: the airport

- "I wrote them mostly on airplanes," Paul Baran on where he wrote his influential memos (ethernet/distributed networks)
	- jet-setting panache? foreshadowing of today's distributed office spaces?
	- indication of a certain social mobility; the result of speaking engagements
  - the experience of communicated (physically) through the airport networks was particularly conducive to writing about communication networks themselves

- its not simply the decentralized qualities of Baran's work, it is the distributed networks that are more radical
	- would have been more fittingly written in automobiles

- interface: a facade, mostly useless and inconsequential. The desk has been outsourced to the passenger. Almost providing tech support to assist us in navigating the interface, rather than  being representative agents of the airline. 

- After the check-in interface comes security. Searches, take off your hat, jacket, shoes, etc. (old techniques). But now data mining, computer vision techniques (faces, gestures monitored). Theatrical experience: certain people with certain roles asking certain questions, and then we have other actors responding. 

- After the security comes the shopping area. All manners of meandering pathways through well-lit store rooms. If security is a line, the shopping is a curve. A clean room, buffered by the security gate. International trade is physically represented. "Made clean for mass consumption."

- The gate: last interface.

- Airport as a succession of interfaces. 

- "Interfaces are back, and perhaps they never left."

- Plato's concept of communication as writing words on the soul of another person.

- The more these devices erase the evidence of their own functioning, the more effective they are. The more invisible they become.

- "To succeed at an interface is at best self-deception, and at worse self-annihilation."                                   o

- In some ways an interface is only an interface when it disappears from view.

- Mediation as the irreducible disintegration of self and others into contradiction.

- Interfaces are 'intuitive' or 'not intuitive'. However, looking at interfaces less as surfaces than as a doorway. The language of thresholds, of doorways,

- Interfaces become important in the issues of cybernetics in that it is the site of discussion of where humans meet machine, or flesh meets metal. Or systems theory, where energy moves from one node to another in the system.

- Interface and media might be two names for the same thing.
	- McLuhan: re-mediation, so-called natural laws of media; media are merely containers that encapsulate other pieces of media. "Onion" model of media. Media are 'scale-based', different layers of scale.
	- Media themselves are interfaces: through the containment concept, it becomes the means by which the encapsulated media can be extracted from the layers
		- the point of friction, agitation between the different layers

- An interface as "putting yourself at the beginning and the end" (a la ancient Greek poetry)
	- the outside 'possesses' the inside
	- introductory liminal modes of expression
	- "An area of , a fertile nexus." The interface is special place that has its own autonomy, an area of choice.

- the 'apostrophe', addressing an object/character and breaking the 

- The 'text' and the 'paratext' (through or beyond text). The paratext is the edge, while the text is the center.

- Diagetic versus non-diagetic.

- "The interface as any artificial differentiation between two media."
	- Any examination of the difference between the edge and the center leads to understanding that it is difficult to disceren where a center begins and an edge ends. Avant garde techniques are very interested in this tension.
	- A web page is entirely artificial. Both are ASCII text but we have nevertheless created an artificial distrinction between the two. The source code of HTML is an interface.
                                                                                       
- We impose a linguistic construct to artiulate the distinction. An interface is not a "thing," it is always an effect, a process, a mode of translation.

- Norman Rockwell's triple self-portrait. A circulation of coherence that gestures toward the outside but ultimately remains afraid of the outside and withdraws from it. 
	- The artist is operating in the white kind of nowhere space (visible in sci-fi through THX 1138 and The Matrix).
	- On the canvas he appears with the soft wisdom of an elder.
	- The image in the mirror is a 'technical' image.
	- Fourth layer of the interface, the image itself, between the viewer and the image. Usually this interface is made invisible. Is this interface acknowledged or repressed?
		- The self-consciousness of the painting 
	- It claims to address concerns of interface within the image itself (diagetic space of the image)
	- A diagetic circuit between the artist, the mirror, and the canvas. A circulation of intesnity, holding inward the energy. The image is a process, not a conglomeration of artistic details.
	- everything is aimed at internalization

- Mad magazine's Alfred
	- has no concern with making himself look better, just in making himself look clever
	- the mode of address becomes the core concern
		- addressing the viewer in an intense way
	- circular coherence of Rockwell is broken into three orthogonal spikes. Orthogonally outward (mirror), orthognally inward (almost at the mirror), and 
	- everything is aimed at externalization
	- direct address to the viewer is "always" treated in a special way
		- narrative forms almost entirely eschews direct address
	- 'short circuit'

- With Rockwell we see an interface that addresses itself to the nterface itself. It answers the question of interface by repressing it. Alfred solves the question of the interface through a schizophrenia. It dwells on the pain of shattered coherence as a result of interface. 

- All interfaces are looking back at us, even when we become engrossed with them ourselves.

- "Interfacing Reality"
	- from a Sony Research Labs project

- Department of interface cultures

- Interfaces in art

- A language of cultural interfaces (from Manovich)
                                                                                                                            ;
- Paul Weibel traces the roots of the word "interface" back to "surgce science"---etymological and conceptual connection between "surface" and "interface."
	- the representation of an interface becomes the interface (a map of the world becomes how we see the world)

- social psychology
	-

- interaction design in the creation of social meaning

- interaction and participation in art.
	- social forms of participation since Dada-ism

- yoko Ono cut piece
	- "Intelliget dialogue about gender relationship, voyerism and the artist-audience relationship

- Examples of Cultural Interfaces
	- Stephen Johnson: "Interfaces will intrude into our lives and it is important for artists and designers to respond to that."
	- Tangible Interface: InfoTable 
	- News Machine
	- Mountain Guitar --- played with body movements

	- Intelligen homes
		- The living room: listening to conversation and looking up keywords

- New interfaces are not generally developed for commercial ends. Avoid pure art or pure commercial applicatins

## van Thije ##

- the notion of interface and how it relates to art, especially in the sense of museum.

- "Systems work because they don't work."
	- If a relation remains, it is because the connection has failed.

- one can act within the realm of an interface or one could engage within the interface
	- play with the limits vs using already understood rules

- an artwork can be an action upon the interface or a moment of density within a system
	- how does a musuem facilitate this?
	- 19th century museums did not display art on the wall in an organized gallery style but rather in an all-at-once manner
		- a direct interface to the art 'depot'
	- the type of knowledge production in a culture is displaed in the interface of museums
	- the development in the early twentieth century of museums towards an exhibition space (a format in itself)
	- 19th century museum was interface pointing to the universal, in the 20th it was towards an individual or even 'dividual'
		- exhibition interface was designed to disappear the body of the audience
		- within the white cube it is just an exercise
	
- how can the interface be approached in these two different ways?

- what is currently happening in the museum space?
	- if the art can no longer function in the Rockwell sense (self-contained, internal focus) and instead focuses on the edges, how do we display it?
	- less and less artwork just objects to collect but rather installations; art can no longer just be collected and put into a depot; when the artwork is a complex interface it allows for contemplation of how to share and/or display this type of art

## Round Table 2 ##

Interfaces and Affect
- 'affective computing': developing interfaces that engage with feelings

### Black boxes vs White cubes ###

AG: We seem to need both these days?

SvT: The exchange between 

: The black box entering the white cube is a great metaphor. Hybrid artforms are entering the white cube in greater and greater scales. Everyone can be artistic these days, and so the technology is at once dissolving the distinction and uniqueness of art in the white cube.


# Object #

## Round Table 3 ##

- *(Summary of Willem van Weelden's absent lecture)*: Essentialism in Latour: hidden in ANT is an endless opening of black boxes. Willem van Weelden calls this a "road to hell." There is less and less margin for space for contentious objects.

### Object Research Lab ###

- Integrating different disciplines (material engineering, philosophy) in day long workshops. This results in translations between the disciplines/discourses.

- What is the Swiss Army going to be lke in the 20th century? None of the individual tools on a swiss army knife are optimal.
	- The morality of the knife: only the officer knives had a corkscrew, enlishted knives had bottle cap openers.

- "Relational thing-ness"
	- A thing is not defined, a thing always exists in relation to other things. 
	- An object can never be wrong, it can be mistreated.
	- An object can never be right, it can be well treated.

- Where do we start talking about the objects? At the molecular level? At the tactile level?

- You can't have a good bicycle without a good road.

- Objects that exist specifically to inspire "thoughts about things."
	- Designed in a single color to reduce distraction and focus on the essence.


## ##

- Theory is going rampant right now. The future belongs to practice. 

- Every object stands as a relation between (at least) two human beings.

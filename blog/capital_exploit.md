# Capitalism meets the Exploit #

## Exploits'R'S ##

Meet the Black Hats. The intertangling networks of actors interspersed across the interwebs, doing the kind of dirt that all those antiheros from the cyberpunk genre get into. (No ghost hacks reported thus far, however.) Organized crime has thoroughly integrated computer espionage into its repertoire. Statistics of reported intrusions are unreliable, served with the disclaimer that many businesses fail to go public with intrusions. No police, no record, no problem.

Things have changed considerably over the last 10 years. While the media machine yelps about its "piracy" problem, an enormous supermarket of dark side opportunity has sprouted into being. By literally choking out real discussion of other issues like net neutrality (what's that?[^1]) and cybercrime. Right now the term 'cybercrime' may as well conjure the image of a couple freshmen savoring their first opportunity at truly high-speed torrentlife, considering that the media companies have largely managed to attach filesharing with criminality in the mainstreams of many nations.

There is another kind of cybercrime, though. When it is covered, it is in the typical fearmongering tone of the 'here's all the fucked up facts, our only hope is more Authority, if there is any hope at all' rubbish that accomplishes nothing. In fact, the largest hack in the history of the world is also significantly under-reported. No New York Times coverage of this. Perhaps it never even happened. Where are the discussions of how to protect privacy on the Internet? Perhaps they are obscured somehow by the importance of Google's business model to the US economy?[^2]

Either way, no media outlet or politician has genuinely, seriously pushed for solving the issue of, for instance, botnets. Let's take a look at what this ever-present aspect of the Internet has morphed into today.

"The chances of a million machine botnet having compromised at least one machine within a target of interest is relatively high."[^7]

[^1]: I agree with Benkler that the best option for that is instituting carrier neutrality on the physical connections a la the Japanese model. See how much traction that gets? Even when it is the _highest recommended_ model in the FCC's own findings, it isn't even whispered about.

[^2]: What I mean by that is this: the entire "Web 2.0" (I'd argue it's more like Web 1.1) business model is based on surplus value extraction. At the core of the value extracted is the face of your identity composed of your browsing habits, your buying habits, your porn habits, etc. Everything you do online can be considered valuable because they can always relate it to what you have done before. The rights to your contributions are often the first that they take away. Just go and look at the Facebook Terms of Service. Napster being shut down is the only reason YouTube is a successful service. The Internet already had a jukebox, and it was better designed architecturally (central indexing of distributed data objects vs a centralized streaming function).

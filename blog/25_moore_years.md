# *Hackers* After 25 Moore Years: Steven Levy Returns to an Invisible Topic #

A personal chord was struck when Steven Levy mentions the impact of his 1984 book *Hackers: Heroes of the computer revolution* on subsequent generations of computer enthusiasts. Following the rabbit hole of microcomputer history from TNT's made-for-cable movie *Pirates of the Silicon Valley* to *Fire in the Valley*, the book upon which that movie was based, the book I found sitting on the table at the Mad Hatter's banquet was *Hackers*. Twelve years later the impact of these early hackers has pervaded the landscape of modern Western life. The excitement and enthusiasm that surrounded the Homebrew Computing Club gave rise to the Steve Wozniak's Apple I. Still considered an incredible hack of hardware, Wozniak's Apple I prototype was released by HP from their first-owner rights due to a distinctly corporate lack of insight. In the words of that event in the *Pirates* script, "What would an average person want with a computer?"

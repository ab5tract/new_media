Blessed be thy files: the art and potential of the software 'soul'
==================================================================


Not that I can say anything about you, but it is not an uncommon phenomenon to find myself stumbling synchronistically into serendipity on the Internet. It was an algorithmic foregrounding of a link to Anne Helmond's review of Software Studies: a lexicon that brought me to the new media program at UvA, after all. So when I stumbled across a piece of software specifically designed to address a longstanding protocological design issue on the internet, I smiled and thanked the presence of the source.

[institute's] yearbook won an award for book design. Curious at their declaration of providing space for practical work of theoretical importance, I took the opportunity to savor some notable typography at the same time as investigating what they meant by that statement. Not to be disappointed, the PDF remediates what is an obviously handsome volume of printed pages. Furthermore, several pages into discussing the theoretical work appeared a description of a new piece of software that fits so neatly into the puzzle of how to solve what is wrong with the Internet that it is necessary to mention it.
